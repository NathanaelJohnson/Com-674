Does anyone on earth actually want Alexa to play a radio station when she can't find the song you asked for?,"I'm on the verge of selling these devices, they are slow and the software is shit.

"Is it just me, or is Alexa getting progressively LESS intelligent?","I got my first Echo 2-3 years ago.  It was limited in what it could do but it got things right most of the time.  I feel like now the goal is to have *some* answer, rather than the right answer.  And there are tasks that it just seems to struggle with that are fairly simple.

Example:  I have a Vizio TV (named ""Vizio TV"") and I use the PlutoTV app a lot.  If I say ""Alexa, open PlutoTV on Vizio TV."" I may get a response saying there are several skills that could work, or it may say it doesn't understand, or it may launch it and say ""Getting PlutoTV on Vizio Smartcast.""  OK, fine... So next time I say ""Open PlutoTV on Vizio Smartcast"" and it has no idea WTF I'm talking about again.

Hue Lights are another struggle for Alexa.  I'll have to repeat myself several times and sometimes she just plain ignores me.

Also, she'll answer a question just because the response has ONE single word that matches what I asked, usually prefaced by, ""According to another Amazon customer.""  Is there a way I can turn that feature off?  Because I could not care less about the opinion of another Amazon customer when I'm trying to get the answer to a question.

Finally, she's going deaf.  I'll be standing 1' from my Echo downstairs and talk in normal voice and the one on the 2nd floor in my bedroom will respond?  How TF do you confuse the location on these two.

In short.  I have several Echos and I am starting to hate them.  It's getting to the point where they are more of a frustration than helpful.",2020-02-25 22:18:29,alexa

Considering switching Google Home Mini for Alexa. Can it do these things that Google Home can't?,"As the title says, I'm thinking of switching. Here are the features that are broken on Google that I'd switch to Alexa for:

1. Reminders. On Google Home, when you set a reminder, at the time it reminds you, it says, ""you have a reminder"", and then you have to ask it to tell you the reminder. This is a really dumb system. Can I set Alexa to give me a reminder and have it just tell me the reminder without me having to ""unlock"" it?
2. Ability to shut off verbal responses. With Google Home Mini, I control my Philips Hue Lights, and every time I make a change to the lights, Google gives me a verbal confirmation. I say, ""Google turn the lights down to 50%"" and Google says, ""Okay, turning the lights down to 50%."" I don't know why, but I find the verbal response really irritating, maybe because it's a mood killer. Can Alexa change my lights without saying anything?
3. Discrete volume control. Google Home Mini only has 10 volume levels, and the difference between 0 and 1 is huge, so it's near impossible to get a decent low volume setting. Can Alexa handle volume in finer increments? Like, work by percentage?

My Echo Buds arrived a day early,"[Pic](https://i.imgur.com/0EFkt4i.jpg)

Amazon began shipping out the pre-orders yesterday.

I have a OnePlus 7 Pro and setup was easy using the Alexa app on Android.  Once paired, you go [into the settings](https://i.imgur.com/WpAwOT6.jpg) in the app and from there you can adjust the equalizer as well as some other stuff, including muting the microphones and customizing the touch gestures.

I'm instantly sold on the Bose Active Noise Reduction (NOT noise cancellation) feature. I wore these while walking downtown in my city today and I could barely hear the sounds of cars, buses and people passing by.  You can double tap either earbud to turn on/off ANR. It's pretty cool how much sound it can drown out.

 I'm not an audiophile, but I'm very happy with the sound these produce, especially when I compare them to the $40 pair of JLAB JBuds I bought from Target earlier a few months ago. I've never tried Airpods or Galaxy Buds, so I can't make a comparison to either of those. One thing I immediately noticed was that the Echo Buds are MUCH more comfortable and secure than my other pair of wireless earbuds.  My other pair would keep falling out needed to be adjusted constantly. 

Of course, having Alexa handy is also really useful.  Skipping tracks, adjusting the volume, etc. can all be done with a voice command. The one issue I had was after about 30 minutes I told Alexa to jump to the next track and she couldn't connect to the Alexa app on my phone, so I got an error message. There's a note on Amazon's website that says OnePlus phones have a battery optimizing feature that may interfere with the Echo Buds, so I've turned off battery optimization for the Alexa app and will see how that goes.

The Echo buds come with three sized tips and some wings, which are fine, but I also went ahead and ordered the Comply memory foam tips which don't come out until tomorrow.  Other than the issue I had with the app, and the fact that the charging case uses Micro USB, I'm really loving these things.

Anyone else plan on grabbing a pair?",2019-10-29 20:00:21,alexa

And another for a Gym that gave you a free Echo Dot when you signed up for a Gym membership has celebrity sports stars asking ""Alexa who is the best boxer/bi-athlete/etc""

Completely Remaking our Entertainment Center,"Recently, my wife and I have been discussing upgrading our TV area. Right now, we are using our XBox One as our hub, but I'll get more into that in a bit. Basically, we'd like to have a bit more Alexa integration and our options are so overwhelming that we need some help getting started. Here's what our smart home looks like so far:

&amp;#x200B;

**The Entertainment Center:**

[This](https://i.imgur.com/bmBHdIp.jpg) is what my entertainment center currently looks like. Here's a breakdown:

* The XBox One is the main control center. I can basically say ""Alexa, tell XBox to launch Hulu"" and from everything being off, it'll turn on the XBox, turn on the TV, turn on the tuner (all done through the XBox One's startup power settings), then navigate to Hulu. It works a good amount of the time, but there are still times I'm stuck using the remote because the skill isn't working the way it should. Even when it does work, I still have to say stuff like ""Alexa, tell XBox to command left"" or ""Alexa, tell XBox to select."" It's fine, but I feel that could be better. We'd like to get away from focusing on the XBox since we mainly just watch TV here. When I do gaming, I tend to play my Switch, not my XBox.
* The TV is an older TV. It won't talk to Alexa. If we wanna turn it on using our voice, we gotta turn on the XBox and do all that crap.
* The Soundbar has no Alexa integration. Like the TV, we gotta turn on the XBox if we want that to turn on.
* The TV and sound bar are both wired to the XBox. That's why the XBox has to be our hub right now.
* Our XBox has Hulu, Netflix, and Amazon Prime Video on it. That's how we access those streaming services.
* The Switch cradle is wired directly to the TV, not the XBox (no more plugs). When I want to play my Switch on the TV, I have to use the shitty TV speakers since the sound bar is wired to the XBox.
* Chromecast: I almost forgot about this little guy. I can load up OneGuide (It's an XBox thing) which allows me to cast from my Chromebook, phone, or tablet to the TV. It's really cool for showing people maps or showing my parents the nauseatingly large amount of [pictures](https://i.imgur.com/ZNwuS9F.jpg) I take of my daughter.

&amp;#x200B;

**The House:**

Just to give you an idea of how far down this rabbit hole we've gone, here's a bit of an explanation of what the rest of the house looks like:

* Google WiFi: We have Google WiFi hubs all throughout our house. I have blazing fast internet everywhere I go on my property.
* Alexa: We've got Dots, Echos, Echo Plusses, and Shows basically everywhere. If I gotta put an Alexa-enabled device somewhere, I've got something within range to control it.
* Philips Hue bulbs: We have smart bulbs in our main living space. We adjust them with our voice, using routines.
* GE Smart Switches: In places like hallways, the laundry room, our pantry, the back porch, and other places that will never need the lights dimmed (just on and off), we put smart switches. I can control it manually (which is sometimes more convenient) or with my voice. There's not one light in my entire house that I can't control with my voice.
* Philips Hue Smart Strips: See those accent lights in teal and orange under the mantle and cabinet? We can adjust those with our voice too. Decorating for holidays is a breeze.
* Arlo: Inside and our, we can see everything when we're not home.
* Nest: We've got the thermostat (which we love) and we're gonna get those smart smoke detectors soon. I've got one in my workshop and it's pretty cool. Someday soon, we're gonna do the rest.

&amp;#x200B;

So from all I've talked about, we're pretty invested in our smart home. For some reason, we feel that our entertainment center could be better. The problem we're having is that when I look online, there's so much to look at that I'm not sure what all I need. I just know that I don't want to run everything through the XBox anymore.

* We're willing to redo everything from scratch. What all do we need to do this right?
* I want to be able to access the XBox One *if I'm going to play games on it, but that's it*. I don't want to use it to watch TV anymore.
* Whether I'm watching TV (in which case the XBox should be off), playing the XBox One, or playing the Nintendo Switch, I want the sound to come out of the sound bar.
* Do I need an Alexa-enabled TV?
* Do I need an Alexa-enabled sound bar?
* How do I control the TV? Where am I getting my Hulu, Netflix, and Amazon Prime Video from?
* Do I need a Fire Cube or something?
* I want to Alexa the fuck out of this.
* I spent a long time making that garland I hung over the mantle and cabinet.",2019-07-09 15:52:30,alexa

Also, naming them Griz Bed and Griz Couch doesn't work, as she starts telling me about a famous Griz with that name. Oi.

I did add them into groups, like Nightstands and Couch so she can easily turn those on, but she also likes turning her individual lights on too. 

Anyone have any good solves they've figured out? I've thought about using His/Her, but it's odd saying His Light to turn on my light.",2019-02-10 22:51:49,alexa

I think Alexa is listening a lot more than Amazon lets on (see text for details).,"The other day my wife came into the house and suffered an allergy attack due to some dusty work I was doing in the living room.  She took some medicine and a shower and asked me if I knew where there were eye drops as she was developing a stye in one eye.

An hour later when she went on Facebook, there was an Amazon ad in her feed for Visine allergy eye drops.  At no point did we engage with the Echo in our living room or do any product searches that would have explicitly gave Amazon this data.

Alexa &amp; The ‚ÄòN‚Äô Word,"Just so you know, this starts with a comedy bit I‚Äôve been working on for a stand-up performance. As with all comedy, it‚Äôs rooted in truth.

I was trying to play ‚ÄòNiggas in Paris‚Äô by Jay-Z. Alexa doesn‚Äôt like that word. I would say the word to her, and she‚Äôs light up, then stop, as if I had said nothing.

But the strangest part is, she didn‚Äôt log it.

So, I started probing. Somewhere on Amazon‚Äôs servers is my voice, saying, with different cadences, inflection, with and without a hard ‚Äòr,‚Äô *that* word.

The most interesting part I could find, without consistency, is that if you ask Alexa a fact, then affix a  soft-r ‚Äòniggah‚Äô to the end, she‚Äôll answer your question, *but she won‚Äôt log it to the app*. With some timing, I could get her to read my messages and tell me trivial information like sun rising, etc, and never logging those actions or recording my voice to the app card.

In some instances, she would hear the word, and drop off as though I hadn‚Äôt said anything to her. In a few other instances, she said ‚ÄúI‚Äôd rather not answer that,‚Äù and logged just that response to the Alexa cards, with my question and the epithet. 

What I‚Äôve found is, with some timing and a ‚Äòbad‚Äô word, you can extract data out of Alexa that does not get logged. I never thought trying to play a song in Spotify would lead me to finding a potential security hole.

Not sure what to do with this. I might share it over at r/NetSec, unless someone has a better place for it. In security, we double-check each other‚Äôs work, so I‚Äôm imagining Alexa having an influx of that word logged into their servers in the coming day. 

That said, I didn‚Äôt try any other ‚Äúbad‚Äù words, but I‚Äôm going to check them out over the weekend; see what I get.",2018-11-03 00:29:53,alexa

Then, when I attempt to give a command, it is misunderstood a very high percentage of the time.   I will say ""Turn off the Couch Lamp"" and it will say ""several devices share that name, which one do you want?""  which is false, no other device shares that name.   Then I repeat the exact same name again ""Couch Lamp"" and it will do it.   Or it will misunderstand again, or shut off, and I have to start over. 

 

I realized just today that rather than deal with the frustration and aggravation of trying to get Alexa to do what it's supposed to,  I've unconsciously started just avoiding the whole mess altogether, and getting up to use the manual switch.

 

I don't know what's happened, but the wake word, and command recognition abilities have gone to shit, and it makes the entire experience a frustration.   Anyone know what's happening?

Alexa in a car and it's the best infotainment system I've ever used.,"I have 2 Echos at home. Recently I bought a Roav VIVA on Amazon, it is a car charger with Alexa built in. 

I'll walk you through how I installed Roav VIVA in my car, what I use it for (just about everything), and why it is the best car infotainment system I have ever used (it turned out to be better than I imagined).

1. Install: Plug VIVA into your car's cigarrete lighter socket. Download Roav VIVA app and add the VIVa device to your app account.
2. Connect: Connect your smartphones to your car stereo via bluetooth. Login with your amazon account to enable Alexa.
3. What I use for?

So far I have used VIVA for the obvious things like playing music and podcasts. The sound is coming from the car's speakers.

I can also make truly hands-free phone calls (""Alexa, call Laura"") or send messages (""Alexa, send a message to Mom"") to other people with Echos or the Alexa app on their phone.

I can control the house lights (""Alexa, turn on the downstairs lights"") and temperature (""Alexa, set the house thermostats to Away"") if we forget before we leave.

And our kids just love goofing around with Alexa, whether it's jokes (""Alexa, tell us a joke"") or games (""Alexa, open the Magic Door"").

4. Why it is the best for car?

The best part of all of this is that everything is now truly hands-free. You never have to look at the display. You never have to reach for the radio or even find that one button on the steering wheel that you can never quite find without looking. It just feels safer.

# And everybody in the car can use it without getting out of their seat, even from the back seat, because of its built in mic to pick both near-filed and far-filed voice compared to using just phones in car.

**Strangely, Alexa actually feels more natural in the car than in the house. While Echos in the house help you do things you could do yourself (i.e., it helps you be more efficient or just lazy), in the car VIVA actually helps you do things you can't ‚Äî or shouldn't ‚Äî do.**

In other words, adding Alexa doesn't feel forced. Alexa feels like she was designed specifically for the in-car experience.

Let me know what you guys think :)",2018-07-20 03:13:58,alexa
Why did all of my Alexas suddenly have a really loud orgasm?!?,"I know this sounds nuts, I really do. 

Last Sunday, I was upstairs in my office doing some writing, and my wife was downstairs painting. Suddenly, every Amazon Echo in the house (8 devices total - a Show, a Spot, 2 gen 1 Echoes, and 4 dots) turns its own volume all the way up, and proceeds to play a recording from Spotify. What recording? Why, the sound of woman masturbating, of course. (The track is called ""Orgasmo Femminile.) We‚Äôre both yelling to each other ‚Äúwhat are you listening to?!?!‚Äù as the whole house is filled with a lot of moaning and ‚Äúoh, oh!‚Äù

I wish I was making this up.

We eventually got Alexa to stop by yelling at her. Then, while we watched (on the Show), the track spontaneously started playing again and the volume turned itself back all the way up. Interestingly, the track was out of sync, and stopping it on one device didn't stop it on all, so it wasn't using the mutliroom music group we have set up. 

We shut down the WiFi, disconnected all of them, and called Amazon. They had never heard of such a thing - the poor support person kept laughing - and told me to do a factory reset on all of the devices.

We have all the devices set up in a group for multiroom music, but A) I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs a voice command to set the volume on all the devices (though there may be), B) there was no TV or radio on to trigger a mistaken voice command, and C) neither me nor my wife said ‚ÄúAlexa, play ‚ÄòOrgasmo Femminile‚Äô on Spotify, everywhere.‚Äù

That last part I‚Äôm sure of.

If it had played a playlist of mine or some music out of my library, I'd be thinking it was just a bug. But filling my house at max volume with the sounds of a female orgasm is pretty clearly a prank. 

I‚Äôm an ex software engineer so I‚Äôm at least reasonably tech savvy - and you don‚Äôt have to be tech savvy to know that this was damn weird.

We did the factory resets just to say we did, and everything's back up and running with no further incidents, but I worked in tech support long enough to know that ""factory reset"" is a catch all tangible task to give a customer that will keep them busy until they call back and talk to somebody else. 

Has anyone ever seen/heard anything like this? Obviously, I don't want it to happy again, and I'm concerned that Amazon doesn't take the security implications seriously. ",2018-07-19 16:37:06,alexa

Alexa has become hard of hearing lately.,"Several months ago when I first gone an echo and several dots it responded really well even when playing music or if the TV was on with other voices in the background.

Then about two weeks ago it suddenly became hard of hearing and it takes multiple tries to get it to ""wake"" and then it often can't figure out what I want.  I tell it to raise the temperature it says ""Sorry, what device?""..  If I tell it to turn on the lamp, of which there is only one, sometimes it will say ""There are several devices by that name"" or something to that effect.

If I'm listening to the radio and a commercial comes on I do not ever want to hear them so I will say ""Computer, volume zero"" to effectively mute the commercials but leave the stream running.  Then a few minutes later when I think the commercials are over I'll tell it ""Computer, volume seven"" (or ten) and music is back.  The raising of the volumes usually works better but when it's playing music I usually have to scream at it three or four times before it will ""wake""..

Another annoying thing that I think may give a clue as to it's hearing problems is for instance, in the morning I'll say ""Computer, play CNBC on Sirius XM, everywhere"" so I can walk about the house and listen to the morning disaster.   Very frequently they discuss tech companies and the word ""computer"" is spoken by ~them~ and when someone on the stream says the word computer, every Echo and Dot device in my house pauses, lights up and sits there listening for further instructions which of course never come.  It mutes the audio stream for about 5 seconds while it figures out what's happening before resuming play.

I also use it to listen to MSNBC via Sirius XM and while the word computer comes up less frequently, the hard of hearing thing is still a problem.
Why it's listening to it's own stream for wake words is beyond me, I thought they would be smarter than that but I guess not.

But still, it doesn't have to be playing anything at all, it's a matter of fact that if I have a TV on or there's stuff running in the kitchen, it's really awful at waking.  And in my kitchen for some reason it's far worse than any other room.  It's a small kitchen but the Dot there is extra hard of hearing and hit flat out will not respond to me unless I mute the TV and turn everything off.  Even then I usually have to yell at it several times.
If I set a timer on it when cooking, it will not hear me at all telling it to cancel the timer, I have to press the button to stop the timer which defeats the purpose of having it in my kitchen.

I think this has something to do with an update that came through a few weeks ago, before that they all worked pretty well but now they are miserable and a few times I came very close to taking a hammer to them.

Is there any hidden settings to fix the microphone sensitivity ?  Something SUCKS and it needs fixing!
