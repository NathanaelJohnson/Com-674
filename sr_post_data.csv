"cmv: I think there is some truth to not putting ""bad"" people in jail and no one is a bad person","Please take my view with a grain of salt.  I don't mean that we should let murderers and people like that roam free and do nothing about it.  I think that no one is really a bad person and it's just their experiences that led them up to doing the things they did, or genetic things and mental illnesses. So instead  of executing them and putting them to jail for life they should be put into programs that can force them to know what happened to them isn't their fault and they can be fixed. Also please try to understand I'm bad at explaining things or what I really mean.",2020-03-25 03:41:16,changemyview
CMV: The “unwritten rules of baseball” are ruining the sport and will ultimately lead to its extinction,"Let me begin by saying that I am a lifelong baseball fan and player. I’ve played the game since I could walk. My father played division 1 college baseball, and after high school I took a different path than my father. I love the game and can watch my braves every game of the season. 

That being said, the unwritten rules, and what I’ll call the “boomer mentality” of baseball are ultimately going to kill the sport, in my opinion. Too many people won’t “let the kids play” or get upset when the younger generation of players show emotion. Heaven forbid someone hits a home run and bat flips, stares someone down, or yells in excitement. We always hear “act like you’ve been there before” and “he better take one to the ribs next time he’s at the plate” and “show some respect for the other guys” and so on and so forth. 

Baseball is already declining in viewership and I could go on about how they might try to fix it, but I feel this traditional mentality of not allowing these exciting things to happen, which would draw in a younger audience, certainly does not help. There is surely something to be said about the long-standing tradition of baseball and the noble history surrounding it, but in the 21st century it is time for us to move on and adapt the game to the audience of 2020. 

If a pitcher doesn’t want someone to celebrate a home run, don’t throw him a pitch that he can tee off on. If you don’t like the way they shouted, strike them out next time. I see guys like Madison Bumgarner and just shake my head and can’t help but think it does more harm than good",2020-03-25 02:29:09,changemyview

CMV: Relationships are stupid as fuck and it’s ridiculous for anyone to be in one.,"I’ve been in exactly one relationship in my life when I was around 15/16, and it didn’t end well. I was somewhat coerced to do things that I didn’t want to do, and as a result, my view of relationships has greatly declined. I think anyone who relies on someone for emotional/mental support is weak and that all relationships only exist for physical pleasure and nothing else. 

I’m, uh, aware that this mindset is extremely incorrect. But no matter how much I tell myself that, I still assume that every person who shows interest in me only wants me for physical shit and nothing else. The one guy from before used lines like “I did x for you, so now you should let me do y”. So now any time I see someone genuinely support or be nice or whatever to another person, I just assume that they’re doing it solely for their own agenda.

CMV: Family doesn't matter.,"Siblings and cousins don't matter since they'll go on their own paths and live their own lives. They might be there when I'm on my deathbed or at my funeral, but all that time in between childhood and death, there's no connection. We only share a common ancestor. That's it.

My family and my cousins barely ever met during childhood. I've never even met half of them. Even if we're friends on FB, we're practically no different than strangers on the streets. Even small talk seems distant like strangers chit chatting while they wait on the bus.My siblings and I also have widely different views and values even though our upbringings are the same. I doesn't even feel like we part of the same family. We don't look  alike either. Now that we're growing up, we've all gone down our seperate career paths in different cities.

Even my parents seem distant after moving out for college and career. Even if I try to reach out, I realize they have their own lives and their world is pretty much each others.

Blood connection is overrated. I'm starting to feel really distant from everyone because of this, which is making me not want to make new connections or friendships. I'm starting to even get tired of making small talk with strangers.",2020-03-25 01:53:31,changemyview

"CMV: It is morally correct to sacrifice a certain number of lives for the sake of the economy. That number is up for debate, but its more than 1.","Andrew Cuomo, the mayor of New York, has made a number of recent statements about the value of human lives and the economy. Here some quotes:

&gt; My mother is not expendable. Your mother is not expendable. We will not put a dollar figure on human life. We can have a public health strategy that is consistent with an economic one. No one should be talking about social darwinism for the sake of the stock market.


.

&gt; If you ask the American people to choose between public health and the economy, then it's no contest. 

.

&gt; I want to be able to say to the people of New York — I did everything we could do. And if everything we do saves just one life, I’ll be happy. 

This is a noble sentiment. But, its wrongheaded. I know it seems cold, but I would argue that its morally correct to sacrifice a certain number of lives for the sake of the economy. 

In the US 1.25 million people die of car accidents every year. 88,000 die of excessive alcohol use. 3,500 people drown. 300 people die of electrocution. 120 people die of sports related injuries. The list goes on. 

So, should we ban cars, alcohol, swimming pools, electricity, and sports? After all, Cuomo argues that there is no price that isn't worth paying in order to save a single life. If we accept this, couldn't you argue that every person should be put in a straight jacket and locked in a padded room? That's truly the only way to ensure that no one dies an unnecessary death. 

Perhaps you would argue that its impractical to lock everyone in a padded room. You'd be damning everyone to a nightmarish existence. You'd be taking away everything from people, and there would be nothing to make life worth living. Its also impractical. How on Earth would such a prison planet be expected to function? Even ignoring the morality, the logistics make no sense. 

If that's your opinion, then you agree with me. At a certain point, you need to give people some degree of freedom in their lives, even if that freedom could lead to their death. The economy is just the mass of people living their lives and trading with each other. Shutting down the economy means shutting down people's lives. 

Perhaps you would object that such a shut down is worthwhile if the threat is dire enough. A shut down is a good idea if it would save a huge number of lives. That's a valid opinion, and I wouldn't argue with you. 

But, at this point, we're debating numbers. We agree that a certain amount of death is worthwhile, we just need to decide how much death is worth a shut down. 

So, that's my argument. While shuting down the economy may be justified in some circumstances, its not as simple as Mr. Cuomo believes. It is justifiable to allow a certain number of people to needlessly die so that the vast majority have the freedom to live active and enjoyable lives. Life is precious. But, there should be a limit to how far we will go to save just one life.",2020-03-24 23:56:34,changemyview
CMV: Abortion is morally wrong,"Now whether or not the government regulates it is a whole different topic, but I want to focus on the moral implications. Disclaimer: I understand there are unusual circumstances, such as rape, chromosomal disorders, or a pregnancy where the mother could die.

First off, I’m a man. Unfortunately, to many people, this disqualified me from the conversation. I disagree. For example, let me compare abortion to the genocides in Cambodia. Saying that because I’m a man I can’t speak about issues concerning women and their bodies is similar to saying because I’m not Cambodian I can’t speak on the issues regarding their government and their genocide of the people. Obviously, these are on different levels of the spectrum, but you get the idea. 

Secondly, a fetus has a potential of a life. It’s not alive, but with natural course it will be. This is similar to a man in a coma who will recover soon, just because you don’t want to take care of him in his old age doesn’t mean you can kill him while he is unconscious, because he will be returning the land of the living soon.

To another point, just because you messed up doesn’t mean you can abort the baby to solve your problem. If you are a female and had unprotected sex with a man and get pregnant, it’s your fault. I understand their are borderline issues such as a condom that breaks, but really people, birth control and carefulness help a lot. If you willingly have sex, and get pregnant, it is morally wrong to kill the fetus if there’s nothing wrong with it. Sounds simple, but there were a surprising number of women telling me it was their choice. I’m not trying to take a right away from you, I just think it’s morally wrong to do so.

In conclusion, I think abortion (excluding those of special circumstance) is wrong and there are other options if you don’t want the baby, such as adoption. The reason I didn’t talk about the government regulating abortion is because I don’t have my mind made up around a solution. I think no abortion is the wrong answer because there are special circumstances previously mentioned, but all abortion isn’t the key either, as it is morally wrong. Maybe a system with applications? This would be hard to do and very time consuming. I’m curious to know what you all think.",2020-03-24 23:45:05,changemyview
CMV: There is nothing wrong or selfish about me not wanting to have kids/start a family.,"Spending my life seeking out my own personal happiness is something that should be recognized as a perfectly valid choice. I do not owe it to anyone to have children, My life is mine to do with what I please and if being child free is what I want then people should respect that and let me live as I see fit. No one has the right to judge the lifestyle choices of anyone other than themself. Having kids can be meaningful, but it can also be horrid. Causing resentment and ruining not only the parent's life but the child's when they are raised by someone who is bitter at them for just existing. Some people are simply just not meant to be parents. Having kids is a choice you can not undo, you can resell a house and you can get divorced but you can not un-have a child, so having one should be a very carefully thought out and only done when the person is extremely sure they want to do it.

Also simply telling me I'll change my mind when I'm older is extremely disrespectful of my judgement and will be responded to as such.",2020-03-24 23:29:01,changemyview
CMV: Health can be improved through peer support in community programs,"I am an orthopedic surgeon who specializes in treating patients who have severe arthritis with knee joint replacement surgery. So many women, particularly women of color, are sedentary and overweight, which leads to their knee joints wearing out (arthritis). I spend time with obese women patients who have mild to moderate knee arthritis, discussing how they can eat healthier and move more in order to lose weight, decrease their knee pain and avoid/defer knee replacement surgery. But they don’t change their behavior. I completely fail as a doctor in supporting them to achieve better health.

But I have seen something else work. When we brought low-income women together, black women with other black women, Latina with Latina, white with white, they got results. In an 18-week community program, we taught them about healthy eating, how to increase their level of physical activity, and how to find personal motivation to adopt healthier behaviors. Their knee pain improved and they had fewer feelings of hopelessness. All without doctors, drugs, injections, surgery, or psychotherapy.

I now know that community-based peer-support programs can change the health of our nation.

A few reasons why...

Community-based programs can be far more cost-effective than individuals being seen by a healthcare provider. Nutrition and exercise programs can be taught in group classes at very low costs.

Community-based programs can be tailored to a certain demographic of a community, e.g., Hispanic women, which allows cultural aspects of healthy lifestyles to be incorporated into the curriculum. Learning how to prepare healthy meals can be tailored to the types of food the participants normally eat. Healthier meals can improve the health of the entire family.

Community-based programs create the environment where people can make connections with each other as neighbors. These connections can support individuals in their journies towards improved health.

Even though I have only tested this with low-income groups of women, I think community-based peer-support programs are essential to improving the health of both women and men of all racial and ethnic backgrounds.

"CMV: r/FemaleDatingStrategy is a toxic, hateful sub filled with bad advice and shouldn't be viewed as a positive community on reddit.","I'm writing this because while in my experience condemnation of or at least acknowledgement of the toxicity, hatefulness, and bad advice-full-ness of ""manosphere"" subs or communities focused around The Red Pill, Pick Up Artistry, or Men Going Their Own Way is nearly universal among people who are not in those communities, I have seen a fair number of people who are not r/FemaleDatingStrategy users come to the defense of FDS with comments like ""oh they're just focused on helping women not get taken advantage of and ensuring they get the most out of dating, there's nothing wrong with that!"" 

This kind of positive outsider view of FDS culminated in an article the [Wall Street Journal](https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/f0phhc/holy_shit_fds_made_the_wall_street_journal/) published about FDS in which they praised the sub for offering ""actually practical advice in the age of dating apps,"" because ""Today’s Tinderella must swipe through a lot of ugly profiles to find her prince,"" and claiming that ""The strategies that FDSers endorse, particularly for online dating, are backed by scientific research"" and concluding that ""If love is a battlefield, communities like Female Dating Strategy are trying to better arm some of the combatants.""

I find it very hard to believe that a major publication like the WSJ would ever publish a favorable piece about a community like PUA or TRP the way they did for FDS. I looked. I found a bunch of major publications who dove into why PUA, TRP, and MGTOW are toxic, hateful, and filled with bad advice, but none praising them. This double standard maintained by many redditors and apparently by the writers for major news outlets in condemning TRP-like communities but not their female equivalents is, more than anything, what prompted me to make this post. It also means that if your counterargument is anything like ""well but TRP is toxic!"" it will not change my view on anything, because I agree with that already. 

To the meat of why FDS is toxic, hateful, and filled with bad advice:

First it's worth looking at who uses FDS. According to [subredditstats.com](https://subredditstats.com), r/GenderCritical, reddit's largets TERF subreddit, has a user overlap of 151 with FDS, and is ranked as the most similar sub; r/PinkpillFeminism, arguably reddit's largest and most overt misandristic subreddit, has a user overlap of 482 with FDS, and is also ranked as the most similar subreddit to it. In short, TERFs and misandrists are respectively 151 and 482 times more likely than the average reddit user to frequent FDS; FDS, thus, mostly populated with transphobes (note it is ""female"" dating strategy, not ""womens"" dating strategy) and man-haters. 

As for hatefulness, FDS maintains a host of dehumanizing terms for men, the most popular of which is ""moid,"" meaning a ""man like humanoid,"" meaning, ""something male but not entirely human."" Another favorite is ""scrote,"" obviously referring to and reducing men down to their testicles, which can be seen in popular FDS flairs like ""The Scrotation,"" or ""Roast-A-Scrote"" or ""Scrotes Mad."" Finally, ""Low Value Male"" (LVM) and ""High Value Male"" (HVM), which is a way FDS divides up men, not unlike the famous 1-10 scale many women find so degrading, like cattle, into groups that FDS sees as having something to offer them (height, a six pack, a six figure salary, a nice house, nice car, a large penis, etc.) and those who don't; if you lack those things, you are a ""low value"" man, according to FDS. 

So lets just stop there for a moment and recap. Imagine there was a male-oriented reddit sub that had nearly a 150x - 500x user overlap with openly misogynistic and transphobic subs. Imagine they routinely referred to women solely as ""non-human female-like creatures,"" or ""vulvas"" or ""holes"" or referred to all women who weren't 120lbs or less with DD breasts and mean blowjob skills and a passion for anal as ""low value."" Right there I think that would be more than enough to say that this hypothetical sub is toxic and hateful, not deserving of praise. 

But FDS is also chalk-full of shitty advice.

I could go on but I'm getting tired of linking stuff from there. I think you get the idea.

The final bit of toxicity and bad advice-nature of FDS took me a while to realize. I'm subbed to a lot of subs dealing with gendered and dating issues: GC, PPF, FDS, TRP, MGTOW, etc. As I said earlier, I regard the male versions of these subs as toxic, hateful, and counterproductive, but one (fairly common sense) thing that they get right is that self-improvement is a major prerequisite in regards to having success with women. Advice like ""lose weight, lift, get a sharp hair cut, upgrade your wardrobe, get a high paying job, get a nice car, and develop an interesting and entertaining personality"" is a dime a dozen on PUA and TRP-type subs. And it's not bad advice; if a guy isn't having luck with women, it makes sense to conclude there's probably something about him that needs to be improved so he'll have better chances. 

It took me a while to notice, but FDS is totally bereft of any advice of this sort. They are not self-critical or interested in any true self-improvement. Their view on this is that all women are, by virtue of being women, automatically maximally awesome and desirable and deserving of Mr. Right or Prince Charming and the only ""self improvement"" required is that women realize this and stop settling for anything less. You will not find, or at least I haven't in like 6mo of being subbed there and *looking,* any posts telling women to work on their appearance or personality in order to help maximize their chances of success in dating. I would argue that this is both toxic and, in regards to dating, textbook bad advice; if you're repeatedly having bad interactions with the opposite sex the most logical thing to do is to examine the common denominator (and also the only thing you really control in the equation - you - and see what you could do improve yourself. FDS skips that step entirely. 

TL;DR: FDS is a toxic, hateful cesspool and a self-reinforcing echo-chamber of bad advice and should be regarded as such, not praised.",2020-03-24 22:53:01,changemyview
CMV: Capitalism is the best and most humane system currently available to us humans.,"I’m going to start by saying that it hurts me to see other people suffering. I would love a world where everyone can live in happiness without worrying about survival/money, I just don’t think we’re ready for that yet.

Things have gotten so much better for humans in the past 30,000 years. People have innovated and died to give us the long, relatively easy lives we current have. I know people like to bash on capitalism and think social policies or communist idealogies are what the human race needs, but I don’t think we’re even close to being ready for that. We have a far way to go, but we’ve made insane progress.

Maybe in the future if we have AI taking care of us, growing our food, making our medicine, etc (or if there’s some sort of technological advancement that makes things easier for humans) we could adopt some sort of socialist system. We simply aren’t there yet, but we are working on it, and the only system that will get us there is a capitalistic one. Without incentive there is no progress, without progress we won’t be able to adopt a system where everyone can live in happiness.

If you really care about the betterment of the human race, you should care about capitalism. It’s literally the best system we have for now. Seeing more and more people support far left ideologies really worries me. It makes me feel like they’re taking everything our ancestors fought and died to provide us with for granted.

CMV: Identifying as apolitical or politically ambivalent is civically irresponsible,"Before I start, I want to clarify that I don't mean that every action we take should be infused with partisan politics. There are many situations, like Thanksgiving dinner, where it would be best if things didn't devolve into screaming matches and where people should essentially assume an apolitical posture. 

Okay, with that out of the way, I'll get to my opinion. There are so many people in life who will completely ignore politics and identify themselves as not really having an opinion on major political issues or figures. More often than not, they treat this stance as a virtue, that caring about politics or reading the news is getting one's self dirty by association. 

I wouldn't say I don't care if someone is a Trump supporter or a Bernie supporter, since I have my own personal stances on how society would best operate, but at least both of those people are focused on trying to make their government and community better. If you don't learn about the issues enough to have a stance on them (ie you don't care if it's a big goverment or small government, if the country should be isolationist or interventionist), your shirking your duty as a resident of the country you live in. 

Of course there are a lot of unseemly elements and moments that make you lose faith in the system, but the solution isn't to give the malefactors more power over the system by refusing to pay attention. Sunshine (and civic participation) is the best disinfectant for dirty government. 

TL;DR: Politics is just a reflection of humanity and it's our attempt to make things better for each other. Deciding you're above it as ""apolitical"" or refusing to learn enough to have an opinion is deciding you don't care if society improves.",2020-03-24 19:53:15,changemyview
CMV: I believe in individuals' rights to contraception. I am also pro life.,"Let it be known that I am not extensively educated on this issue, and my current opinion on this issue is mostly based on values that I have tried to form on reasoning that may be fundamentally wrong. I am also male, which certainly does not help with perspective.

I do not want to have children, and I do not think I will ever want children. I support anyone's right to whatever means they want short of an abortion to prevent having a child, whether its ""the pill"", implants, sterilization, pretty much anything on [planned parenthood's site](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control). I even intend to get a vasectomy as soon as I am able to afford one.

I do not support abortion because at that point, the potential for a new human life has started. We can certainly talk about the science of whether a fetus counts as human or not, but my objections to abortion are mostly moral. If a pregnancy is successful and the fetus is brought to term, out pops a human being. No matter the worth that human being would bring to the world, I believe a human life is precious and should be cared for. Even if a fetus is not human, it eventually will become one. I do not see why denying a human a chance at life is acceptable in most circumstances. In that case at least, I can not support abortion either. I understand that bringing a pregnancy to term has lasting physical effects on a woman, and I am certainly not aware of all of them, but what I have read with just a quick Google search are not serious enough to warrant ending a future human's chance of life.

CMV: Bernie's plan to give 20% of large companies to their workers is bad for workers and the economy.," 

I'm referring [Bernie’s plan](https://berniesanders.com/issues/corporate-accountability-and-democracy/) that forces large companies to give their workers 20% ownership in the companies they work for. 

I strongly believe that workers should have more say in how companies are run. I support laws that give workers seats on corporate boards. I’m fine giving workers 20% of the vote. I also support raising the minimum wage to reduce income inequality.  However transferring ownership won’t add much of an additional benefit to workers and will be extremely harmful to people who own companies.

**The Harm to Owners**

Basically Bernie’s plan is going to reduce the value of the stock for all large companies by 20%, since this is transferred from the current owners to workers. Sure this will hurt the rich who can take the hit. But this will also hurt everyone who has a retirement account or a pension that invests in stocks. It will hurt everyone with retirement savings, while befitting people who currently work (the employees that get the ownership). It doesn’t seem that fair for people who saved for retirement to lose 20% of the money they invested in stocks.

**First off giving companies ownership stakes won’t increase the incomes for most workers**. 

Bernie estimates that under his plan the average worker for large companies will receive $5,000 a year in dividend payments. For most workers this won’t increase their income; companies will simply cut their salary, so most workers are going to end up making the same amount of money. There are tax issues (explained below) that could potentially cause companies to reduce worker’s take home pay. 

Now it may impact workers that make minimum wage (or just above minimum wage). But all of a sudden it's going to be a whole lot cheaper for large companies to contract these jobs out to smaller companies that aren't effected, since they can pay their workers a lot less. You're going to see a huge wave of companies outsourcing these low wage jobs. Workers at these smaller contractors will have less job security, worse benefits and lower wages than they would have had with the bigger company. Workers won’t be able to stop this, because Bernie’s plan only gives them 2% ownership per year.

More importantly his plan only impacts 56 million workers, it won’t impact the other over 100 million workers in the economy. If you want to raise wages for low income workers, then the country would be better off just raising the minimum wage.  

**Worker ownership of companies is going to increase inequality**

Assuming that this plan would increase workers' take home wages (which I doubt), it would increase income inequality. A bunch of large companies, like Google, Facebook, Amazon and Berkshire Hathaway don’t pay any dividends. Some companies (like the big oil companies) pay out huge dividends. If worker’s income does increase, would it really make sense to pay it out to only some companies?

Either way you slice it, this is going to increase wealth inequality. Worker’s ownership stake in companies is a source of wealth even if it doesn’t increase their income. This is going to be great for employees of companies like Goldman Sachs and Facebook, which are very valuable companies but have a relatively small number of highly paid workers. Workers for these companies are already making plenty of money, there isn’t any reason to give them more wealth. 

This won’t give a dime to the 100 million works that work for companies that are too small.  Workers for companies that have huge workforces like Walmart (which has 1.5 million employees) will see far less of benefit, because their ownership stake is spread over so many people. Workers for these companies generally aren’t that well off- they are exact workers we should want to help out. Bernie’s plan won’t help them much. 

**This will expose workers to more risk if their employer tanks**

Investment advisers always tell their clients to invest in a diverse portfolio of assets, so if one goes down hill, you don’t lose your savings. Bernie's plan essentially forces workers in large companies to tie up a large portion of their wealth in their employer. This exposes workers to a huge amount of risk, since a bunch of their eggs are in one basket. If your company hits a hard time, workers risk losing both their job and the equity in their company. 

Companies effected are going to feel less obligated to contribute to employees retirement accounts, since they already own 20% of the company's stock- they already have a big chunk of savings 

The United Auto Workers union ended up owning over half of Crystal and nearly 20% of GM after they went bankrupt in 2009. They ended up selling off their stakes because they found that it exposed their members to too much risk. They took that money and invested in a more diversified portfolio. If unions won’t hold large stakes in their workers' companies, it doesn’t make a lot of sense to force it on the whole economy.

**Tax issues** 

Companies have to pay a higher tax on the money they payout in dividends than wages. Companies have to pay 21% on dividend payments and roughly  to 9% on wages (at the federal level). Some of the extra 12% might come out of worker’s pockets which could bring down their take home pay.",2020-03-24 19:07:47,changemyview
"CMV: Time, memories and age don’t exist","All that exist is NOW, that’s the exact truth. What is the exact-exact truth is that reality is nothing and made out of nothing. Thanks to quantum physics. This is a fact. 

Entropy is what all there is to this reality on the ground level. Good entropy results in good outcomes in the now. Bad entropy results in bad outcome in the now. Good entropy could be the cold hard cash that is building up in your wallet. Bad entropy is the cancerous cells that divide uncontrollably. Entropy is growth in whatever forms that is received by our 5 senses. Entropy can occur in the womb as well, Resulting in genetic conditions. The only answer to that is to lessen the impact by getting more good entropy.

Another thing that is the truth is maturity. Age should define your status in reality. That’s all there is to that 

You may ask about time,age and memories. Where do they come into this. Well none of them exist. They are illusions. Age is not definite. Your biological age could be different from your chronological age. And who cares when you are born anyway. How is that going to contribute to your true reality. Time doesn’t exist. This is proven by physics. Time is just a tool created by us to organise our reality. It’s nothing more than that. Time should only be used productively. Entropy should replace time. For example I have a appointment in 10 mins. I note that in my mind but don’t give it any emotion because it is just a measurement of a mental tool. Meanwhile  I think of way to get more good growth in my life (entropy)

Then we come to memories. What do we do about the good and bad memories we have. We let go of them and reject them as figments of our mind. Memories don’t happen now. They happen in your mind. That is also where you imagination comes from. Every time you recall the memory, they become less accurate. So what’s the point in adding meaning to them. 

If you do someone wrong you should pay the consequences, right. This could be someone remembering you then reporting you to the police. So memories are valid then, you may think. The thing is if everyone follow this way of living, that is timeless, ageless and without any attachment to memories. I guarantee that such crimes will not occur but only natural accidents will. because of the more defined moral system that can derived from this way of thinking.",2020-03-24 18:55:10,changemyview
CMV: Former top athletes would be every bit as dominant today as they were back in their day.,"I'm a big sports fan and since we have no North American sports to watch, there's a lot of replaying of past games of every sport.  This has sparked a few conversations I've seen where someone says that Player X wouldn't be able to compete in today's game because the game has changed so much.  I'll use hockey as an example.  People say that there's no way Gordie Howe or Maurice Richard would be able to compete in today's NHL.  

Those guys played hockey part time, and only during the season. Hockey players grew up playing hockey in the winter and some other sport in the summer, and they literally only got on skates when the hockey season started, and as soon as it ended, they hung them up for the summer.  Then when they made pro, they didn't make the money that players make today so they had to supplement their income by returning to work on family farms or selling cars, real estate, insurance, whatever.  The only reason Tim Horton's exists today is because he opened a business to supplement his income.  They didn't train at all during the summer and literally used the two week training camp before the season to ""get in shape.""  The gear they used was also very primitive, heavy, mostly leather, cotton, and wool (all heavy materials, leather and cotton getting even heavier when wet), and very little technology in the skates and sticks departments.

By contrast, today's NHL players have been on skates year-round since the age of 5-10 practicing, training, and playing literally 12 months of the year for a solid 10 - 15 years under mostly advanced coaches and trainers before making pro, where they now have even more access to more advanced training, nutrition, and ""sports science.""  The gear they use is all engineered to deliver the most performance possible and is all custom fitted and designed to maximize each player's potential - especially skates and sticks.

So if Gordie Howe or Bobby Hull were born alongside today's crop of elite NHL players, they'd still be right there with them.",2020-03-24 18:26:48,changemyview
Cmv: universal healthcare in the United States,"I believe everyone should have access to healthcare. Everyone should be able to go to the doctor and receive the same quality care, equally as everyone else. There are so many people in the United States who have medical debt up to $1 million just because they don’t have the money to afford it. With universal healthcare, everyone will have access to care and they will not have debts and more people will seek access to care because insurance will cover it. 

Currently, the individual mandate is not under law. So by people not getting insurance, they won’t get penalized by it. This causes more people not to get insurance, of course, because if they don’t need it or they’re not sick, they won’t get it. However, what if they get sick and then need to get a medical procedure or need to get care? I do think that universal healthcare is the answer. People won’t have to worry about their health because they will have all the access they need. We should learn from countries such as France, Italy, Australia who have implemented that type of healthcare system.",2020-03-24 18:14:24,changemyview

This can be very off-putting to new users who could be confused as to why their posts are being removed, and in addition users could put a lot of effort into creating original content that just gets removed immediately without a chance to be viewed.

If every sub specified the exact account age and karma required to post there, then people would be more motivated to post higher quality content elsewhere on subs to gain the karma that they need to post in a sub with stricter rules that they have created original content for. 

The subs that don't currently have a restriction on account age/karma would be unaffected, since this requirement would only apply to subs that have a restriction.

CMV: I’m going to circumcise my child when the time comes and think it’s the right choice,"Basically, the title. 

I’m a circumcised man and it’s been no issue for me my entire life. Stuff still feels good, I don’t have any scarring, and I just like the look of a cut rather than an uncut.

I always see people spouting on Reddit about how it’s child abuse, it should be banned, people who do it should be locked up, etc. 

I don’t understand that at all. I don’t remember any pain (was done at birth so of course not) and Google says the pain only lasts for a few days and like any other pain can be treated with medication. 

Getting a root canal causes pain and it’s rememberable but no one calls it mutilation.

Same thing with piercing ears. It’s done purely for cosmetic reasons and also modifies the body and causes pain. 

My only real reason for circumcising is that I think it looks nicer, and the vast majority of my friends agree. 
I don’t want my kid to be bullied in the locker room because he’s uncut like some other kids I knew in HS. 

I’m not stuck in this view and would like other reasons why not to. But to me, it seems it doesn’t matter too much for either choice. I can’t think of any negatives for picking one or the other and it just comes down to preference.

CMV: Africa and Asia would still be full of developing countries even if they were never colonized.,"A  lot of the abject poverty and instability present in countries within  Sub-Saharan Africa or South America or the Middle East or Southern and  Southeast Asia is blamed on European colonialism.

It  is true that European colonialism brought with it many atrocities like  the Belgian Congo massacres or the genocide of Tasmanians or Indian  famines or sexual slavery in Asia, etc. However, many of the places (but  not all) that fell to European suzerainty were less technologically  advanced than the Europeans and have been that way for a long time.

What  the whole developed/developing dichotomy hides is that being a developing country is normal, a well-developed country is rare (only  like 1/3 of nation-states are developed). What all developed countries  have in common is that they either have a very industrialized society, or they have key resources that are intelligently and properly  exploited, or they have some interpersonal factors that draw people and  wealth to their lands like being a tax haven. Not a lot of countries  have any of those key factors and even nations with resources have  problems using them and still keeping a good economy due to the resource curse.

So  in conclusion, first-world country status isn't some natural state of a sovereign nation that evil foreign meddling gets rid of. It is something  that has only occurred relatively recently in history due to  socioeconomic factors. If colonialism never happened, many regions of  Earth might be a lot more politically stable than they are now, but it is silly to think that Nigerians or Pakistanis or Yemenis or Filipinos  would be colonizing Mars by now if the Europeans never showed up. In actuality, some of the countries that got colonized the least like Bhutan, Ethiopia, Thailand, Liberia, or Haiti are still poor nations that are no better off than their colonized neighbors (or in Liberia, Ethiopia, and Haiti's  case, a lot worse).",2020-03-24 15:30:43,changemyview
"CMV: Women are typically made out to be the ""bad guy"" when it comes to unwanted pregnancy unless she decides to keep the child.","Recently I've been seeing a lot of posts (mostly on r/AITA) depicting a pregnant couple where the mother does not want the child and the father does. I feel like the woman is made out to be the bad guy no matter the choice she makes. If she puts the child up for adoption, the father misses out on being a father. If she aborts the child, the father misses out on being a father and may blame the mother for ""killing"" his child. If she surrenders custody to the father, she must pay child support for a child she would have preferred to abort. If she surrenders support, she also runs the risk of being shamed for being a ""deadbeat mother"" for not wanting to be part of her child's life. 

It just feels like women are expected to either assume full responsibility for the child, or to assure that she never gets pregnant, even though it takes two!

I feel like the father has it easy. He has no control of whether or not the child gets aborted and thus will not be branded a murderer, he will not be ridiculed for not being a part of the child's life. You hear them being called ""deadbeat dads"" for sure, but it is definitely more socially acceptable for a man. Yes, he will still have to pay child support for a child he did not want, but he also would not have to deal with being blamed for aborting the child if that were the choice. 

The father not having a say is definitely an injustice, but that's not the view I'm trying to explain. I think that no matter the choice a woman makes, unless it is to keep the child, she is made out to be the bad guy whereas the father typically is not.

I desperately want to see that this isn't the case and that the difficulty is equally matched especially when the woman is already plagued with the physical and emotional hardships of actually carrying the child.",2020-03-24 15:18:18,changemyview
CMV: One-time and isolated verbal abuse and harassment shouldn't be punished as much as it is.,"I feel like verbal abuse and verbal harassment is overplayed in terms of how much harm it can do to someone, particularly in one-time and isolated incidents where the perceived verbal abuser/harasser says something hateful or hurtful only one to a few things to the perceived victim and either stops on their own or stops after they're told to stop. I really don't feel like the victim should even be taken seriously in cases like this unless there was something tangible to go along with the abusive, hateful, or threatening remarks. Maybe it's just me but I've experienced things like this many times before and nothing has ever come of any threats that I've gotten.

For instance if someone sent me an email or called me or texted me saying ""I hope you die"" or ""Kill yourself"" or ""You don't deserve to live"" or ""I wish you would die"" and stopped, or stopped when I asked them to please stop I honestly wouldn't care and definitely wouldn't go to the police. If someone said something like that to me but also tried breaking into my home or mailed a bullet or followed me, then I would feel the need to report them to the police, regardless if they stopped or not. 

I really don't feel like someone should go to probation for something like this. I feel like it really doesn't help anyone. If someone repeatedly did this without stopping especially after you tell them to stop, then I can see why that person should be reported but in one-time or isolated cases like I was talking about before, I personally find it to be really silly, particularly if the perceived verbal abuser/harasser is young.",2020-03-24 15:05:56,changemyview

CMV: Trump should declare a National Emergency and permanently eradicate leftism from the United States,"Most recent articles have focused on a different existential threat to America, but I believe the existential threat of Leftism is the greatest threat of all. My view is that Trump should declare a national emergency to deal with this threat, until the threat has been eradicated.

I recently discovered that, in a time of national crisis, Democratic leaders were concerned with protecting the jobs of foreign nationals and illegal invaders at a time when 20% of AMERICAN workers could lose their jobs. This defies all comprehension. This is treason to the citizens they represent. There is nothing they could do or say to justify or redeem themselves for this action.

For years, the left has tried at every junction to make us weak. To make us think of foreigners, refugees, minorities, everyone else except for our own people as we languish and suffer, as we're replaced in our own counties, as we can no longer even walk down our own streets without hearing someone speaking Spanish on an American street. 

We're told we have to sit there and suffer in silence at this affront. That we dare not speak up and reclaim our countries, or we face losing our jobs, our homes, because all it takes is being called ""racist"" in this sick country to have your life destroyed.

This can't be fixed by voting. This is a maggot infestation at the highest levels of politics, and their control of the press, hollywood, media, and entertainment has subverted the minds of too many impressionable youth who believe they're genuinely doing the right thing by supporting these pseudo-altruists. But it cannot be tolerated anymore. Our nation will die. 

My belief is that the only thing we can do, not out of contempt for human rights but out of sheer desperation to preserve our own, is to declare a national emergency to combat this plague. Those who have inflicted this disease upon our nation will come to a great day of reckoning as our nation is reborn. 

Our youth will show their love for their Nation, their People, their Folk, and the land and the nation will show their love back, as we march forward towards greatness. No Randgruppenpolitik. No BLM to divide us. One National people marching forward in strength and honor.

CMV: We should stop reproducing,"My position is antinatalism. My basic argument is this: You should not impose a negative experience on someone else. 

Now, life is a *net* positive experience for most people (they would say), but it always includes negative experiences in it. 

When you have a kid, you are creating a person who will have all these experiences. Your action (having a kid) will lead to a new person experiencing negatives. 

Here are some of these negative experiences that everyone will have:

(Also, keep in mind that risk is itself a negative. Even if you may not experience a certain negative thing, being exposed to the risk of it is also negative). 

1. 100% of people will experience death. 

2. A fraction of the people will experience horrible things like car crashes, murder, rape, war, disease, accidents, assaults, climate change, etc. In addition, *every person* is exposed to the risk of these things. Even if the risk is small like 1%, the risk is still a negative. 

3. No person chooses which family or environment they're born into, even though this is crucial in determining (or affecting) how their life turns out. The risk of being born into a bad environment or family is a negative. 

4. Every person will experience negative emotions like sadness. Every person will experience negative events like an argument, break up, loss of a loved one, etc. 

My argument is not that a negative experience/feeling is in itself bad. It's that *imposing it on someone else* is bad, which is exactly what happens when you have a kid. 

For example, I would say it's ok if a person wants to do things like drink alcohol or intensely work out. These things come with negative consequences or pain, but the person is doing it to themselves and they can make that choice. However, it's wrong to force someone else to drink alcohol or work out intensely. 

Also, my argument is not a pro-death or anti-life position. I think life has a lot of positive experiences and people can and should live a life that maximizes their well-being while not harming others. I just think it's better to not have kids.",2020-03-24 03:03:21,changemyview
"CMV: I don't care what other people say; WALL·E is a cinema classic, and is much smarter than many of the supposed ""adult"" movies. It must be considered part of high cinema.","Yes, WALL·E is a great masterpiece in my opinion. People who claim that mediocre adult movies like The Titanic are better because they're popular, traumatic, sexy, violent, etc are extremely shallow. Don't get me wrong, movies with blood and sex like Pulp Fiction also deserve their place, but that's not the primary reason they're there. WALL·E perhaps gives one of the most daring messages that a kids' movie can give about capitalism, consumerism, and globalization. It also touches on topics like separation of human and nature (and drawing the line with words such as ""foreign contaminant""), willful surrender of human autonomy, and laziness. Stupidity of pop culture and its blind observance by the masses, indoctrination from young ages, and a disregard and indifference to knowledge about the past, or even the present moment are also explored in the movie. But, from the very basics, designs and visuals of the robots are top-notch to start with. It's perhaps reasonable to think that this is not a CGI movie and that WALL·E is an actual robot in the first part of the movie. WALL·E's design is so basic, so retro, so crude, yet its ability to move in a million different ways without sacrificing any of these qualities, its ability express many different human-like qualitied with such a simple engineering is the real killer. It's as if the robot's actually there, and you think why nobody has ever done something like that before, because it's just too smart. Again, our deuteragonist EVE's design is also pretty cool. It represents beauty in such a unique way. All in all, the design elements and the storytelling make this movie top notch, but there's probably much more things about it that I haven't mentioned yet that make this movie so damn great.",2020-03-24 01:17:28,changemyview

Cmv: If you took out student loans you knew what you were getting yourself into and it shouldn't be forgiven by the government.,"Now generally I'm for the government helping people when they should but student loan debt is the biggest non issue being talked about now. It proves that people that say millennials are entitled are right.

So let me get this straight:
1. You decided to go to college without a full scholarship so you knew you would have to take out loans or pay out of pocket.
2. You signed up for loans with interest rates that you could not manage. This is not something a level headed person does. What's the point of math class if you didn't use it to predict the hole you dug for yourself?
3. You kept going to college knowing it was getting too expensive. 
4. You were never guaranteed a job post graduation.

In my opinion there is no excuse for those 4 things. If you graduated, you were given hard to reach knowledge in a subject so you should be able to use that to make a living.  If you can't then that is your fault entirely.

If I sign up for boxing classes and at the end of the course I'm not a world champion I can't just flake on the payments.

Too many millennials thought if they followed their parents and teachers orders they'd be living it up now. Educated people will always make more than non educated. There is nothing to complain about. 

Educated people act better than non educated people but get salty when they have to work the same job. If you went to college and can't use the degree then you are stupider than someone who never went to college. Just accept it.

Colleges and universities are being demonized like they were predatory but it was students who chose them and applied and wrote essays hoping to get accepted. That is the opposite of predatory.

If they expunge student loan debt they should also expunge degrees and academic records. You shouldn't get to finesse a degree out of an institution by whining. People avoided college to avoid the same debt situation. They should give those who didn't go to school a check for the average amount of student debt.

CMV: The importance of abortion rights is overplayed,"It seems that a lot of women feel entitled to sex without any consequences; men are asked not to complain if they aren't having sex so if women weren't hypocritical, they would accept that sex has severe consequences and that having sex isn't a right (i.e. if you don't want a baby, don't have sex).

Besides, if you don't want to give up on PIV sex, you can have other forms of sex e.g. oral where the risk of pregnancy is 0. Women all the time say that they prefer other forms of sex to PIV and that they can't orgasm from it. It appears that the issue isn't over abortion, it's over people telling them that they have to be more careful about sex (which they interpret as men trying to control their bodies).

CMV: Western audiences are wrongly identifying with the Greeks in Zack Snyder’s movie “300”.,"It’s understandable why some people in the west have chosen to identify with the Spartans. They are a group of beautiful, capable free men who rule over a conservative, patriarchal, homogeneous and militaristic - borderline fascist - society. When the traitorous Jews (Oracle priests) and democratic institutions try to hold them back they do the “right thing” and head out to wage war regardless.

Why do they fight? To defend their homeland against an amorphous horde of Middle Eastern and Central Asian invaders.

So far so obvious. And phrases like “This is Sparta” or “Come and take them” have become part of the English language. The movie was basically made for Neocons and has since become the Rosetta Stone of the Alt Right.

But they were fooled.

America in fact is the Persians. And the best analogy to the Spartans in the modern world is the Taliban in Afghanistan or the IRGC in Iran:

Greece in the movie is a small, poor and backwards country being invaded by a much larger Empire with vastly superior military technology.

The Greeks live in a deeply superstitious tribal society constantly squabbling with each other. They fuck young boys. They fetishize health and physical strength, death and martyrdom, etc.

[Persian culture](https://youtu.be/nhMOGixYG8s) on the other hand is liberal and cosmopolitan, accepting of difference. They are body-positive and not ableist, etc.

And what is Xerxes’ goal? He is not a religious fanatic bend on destruction. He is a reasonable and understanding ruler who wants bilateral trade and cooperation. He offers Leonidas peace and prosperity if he joins ~~global capitalism~~ the Persian global empire. If only he accepts Persian supremacy Leonidas can rule over all of Greece.

CMV: You can't get better at singing - trained singers sound horrible.,"Singing is a natural talent, and if you don't have it you don't sound good regardless of your training.  


It always super annoyed me when I'd listen to people who claim to be trained singers - they sound stale, empty and boring. Sure they can hit the notes, but it's like it's being produced by a robot trying to imitate a human singing. A great example would be a lot of people who participate in performing arts - their voices just aren't something worth listening to e.g. did the world's greatest showman really need 18 million views on it's main theme?   


I saw a similar post to this where this video was referenced in favour of trained singers:   
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTX9LxZ9YUQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTX9LxZ9YUQ)   


and the OP responded something like "" wow you've completely changed my mind"".  


This guy still sounds horrible. His whole 10 years of training was a complete waste. I'm sure there's so many things he could have been good at, but seeing people gas trained singers up like they don't sound absolutely horrible when compared to real singers is hella annoying.  


When you compare trained singers to someone like   
Sam Tomkins (Left)  :  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8nBzrhd8Ro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8nBzrhd8Ro)

I'm sure if you put his voice through an autotune you'd fine some notes that aren't perfect, which could be perfect for more trained singer, but it still sounds lightyears better than something that could come out of Wicked the Musical etc.

CMV: People who choose not to have kids should not receive the pension (possibly other social programs also) after retirement.,"A view that circles my head a lot is that people who choose not to have kids should not receive the pension upon retirement.

Given that most countries with social programs are running up massive debt (Aus and US), and these countries are facing higher average ages in their citizens it makes sense to withhold a pension for those who do not meet replacement levels (2.1 kids) with their family size.

Raising children is an 18 year plus commitment that requires physical, emotional and economical sacrifice from parents and economical input from the tax system (schooling etc). That 18 year commitment to raising future economic participants should be rewarded with a pension as their sacrifice has provided a long term investment for their community/nation. Meanwhile a childless parent does not undertake the same sacrifice but receives the same reward from the state.

People who choose not to take that sacrifice have an extra 18 years to bfocus solely on themselves to build up their savings/investments to get them through their olden days.

Fact is that our taxes no longer provide ourselves with the pension, we will rely on the younger generations to provide for us (Aus introduced superannuation to help combat this and relies heavily on immigration to lower the ageing population)


I've provided my own con list but I don't think these negate my view
Cons to this:
-Having kids should not rewarded with incentives nor should they be view as economic investments
-Childless adults still pay towards education etc (although they benfit from this themselves by assisting in educating their community)
-exceptions would need to be made for ill/disabled people who could not raise kids (people who are infertile could still adopt?)",2020-03-23 19:31:11,changemyview
"CMV: Marx &amp; Engels wouldn’t have agreed with Lenin, and Lenin would have done what he did even if he had never read Marx","Lenin became a communist revolutionary cuz he had been influenced by his anarchist brother. The three authors who pushed Lenin to become a revolutionary were Tchernychevski, Blanqui and Netchaïev (a redditor told me that the latter was influenced by Marx but I’ve never read that anywhere so I don’t think that’s true, prove me wrong if you can.)

What Marx &amp; Engels wanted was a proletarian communist revolution that would happen after the collapse of capitalism. But that collapse never happened because unions and reformers managed to give capitalism a human face after the gilded age. Therefore all marxists had to do next was turning into social reformers, like Eduard Bernstein and Karl Kautsky.

Even though Engels didn’t really like social reforms, Marx did (see : Marx and social reforms by Bernstein).

Lenin thought the proletariat was too dumb to know what’s good for them, therefore what he did was a coup (not a revolution) where he and his buddies took power. He called it the dictatorship of the proletariat, which is dumb because neither him nor his buddies were proletarians (Trotsky came from a kulak family).

Marxists (including guys who had met Marx himself) such as Plekhanov, Axelrod, Kautsky, Jean Longuet (Marx’s grandson) said Lenin was a moron. Btw, Plekhanov was the guy who introduced Lenin to marxism, and after a while Plekhanov urged the provisional government to arrest Lenin.

Yes, as Kolakowzki said, it is dishonest to pretend that what Lenin did had nothing to do with marxism. Marxism maybe gave Lenin sort of a justification for some his crimes : he was doing them in the name of science (scientific socialism) and in the name of history (history’s laws and the INEVITABLE revolution), therefore not in the name of crazy ideas.

Marx was also pro-authoritarianism, but that’s because he lived in a time where almost every European regime was authoritarian, and he wanted the proletariat to form their OWN authoritarian government to fight against the OTHER authoritarian governments.

But Marx also said that he was firmly against any cult of personality, against capital punishment, against slavery, and against colonialism (thanks to chartist Edgar Jones). Marx also encouraged doubting everything, which is the opposite of what Lenin, Stalin or Mao encouraged (Lenin said that Marx’s science was « omnipotent ». Btw, I think Lenin is responsible for turning communism into a religious doctrine, cuz he was the first communist to put himself as a great leader in front of everyone, and with his rethoric and his famously seducing speeches he stole the heart of many people.)

My point is : the communist experiment of the 20th was based on Lenin’s ideas, which was a mix of a lot of ideas, including some of Marx’s ideas.

But I think that if Lenin had never read Marx, he would have still been a revolutionary, and would have still done the october revolution. He would probably have called himself a tchernychevskist instead of a marxist.

So if you wanna dwelve into the simplistic narrative that only one man changed a whole century, instead of blaming Marx, blame Lenin.

But seriously though, that’s too simplistic guys. You can’t change history by killing just one guy. If we had killed baby Lenin, then Bukharin, Stalin and Trotsky would have been the leaders of the october revolution. If you killed baby Hitler, then Goebbels or Himmler would have been the furher.",2020-03-23 19:23:04,changemyview
CMV: I think it’s likely that Bigfoot may exist in very small numbers.,"Here’s why.

1. There have been more than [10,000](https://www.foxnews.com/tech/sasquatch-watch-bigfoot-sightings) reports of Bigfoot sightings in North America in recent years. There’s no way ALL those people are liars or misunderstood what they saw. If enough people are seeing it, some have to be legit 


2. There are animals we once thought were extinct but later found out [weren’t ](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.thetravel.com/14-creatures-scientists-thought-were-extinct-but-arent-11-gone-forever/amp/. Bigfoot could be a subspecies of [primate](https://study.com/academy/lesson/extinct-primates-chororapithecus-pierolapithecus-samburupithecus.html) that we assumed was extinct but isn’t and is just highly elusive.  

3. [Scientists](https://www.currentresults.com/Environment-Facts/Plants-Animals/number-of-undiscovered-species-living-on-earth.php) estimate there are around 5 million undiscovered animals with around a dozen or so of them being mammals. Big foot may be one of them. 


4. To my last point, you could argue that if there was a large ape or primate roaming around in the wild we’d have found it by now, however the mountain Gorilla (which mind you had existed for thousands of years before) was believed to be a myth for a long time until it was discovered to be real in [1903](http://www.animalplanet.com/tv-shows/monster-week/mythical-animals-that-turned-out-to-be-real/). Bigfoot could be the same situation. 


5.  hair samples claiming to be from Bigfoot have been reviewed and a lot of them came back [inconclusive ](https://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/us_2199984),not belonging to any known ape or species, since we’ve supposedly discovered all of the large primates, why don’t we know where these came from?

CMV: Arch Linux easier to set up than most Ikea furniture and people should stop using it as badge of honour.,"For the uninitiated, (Arch linux)\[[https://www.archlinux.org/](https://www.archlinux.org/)\] is one of numerous different (Linux)\[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux)\] distributions, the most well known being Ubuntu, Mint, Fedora etc. These are free, open source and all you really need to get linux going on your computer is a pen drive.

Arch linux is unusual in that it is installed at the command line, rather than via a simple user interface. Each step of the instillation has to be done manually and, for example, a fresh arch install doesn't come with a desktop environment - you install that yourself.

Before I start I should say that I use Arch linux (by the way!), as a daily driver and really like it. The package management (installing and updating) is a breeze and,  I am lead to believe, the OS does not require regular re-instillation. Though one loses track of dependencies, I know everything I have installed. Moreover, an arch install is an excellent learning exercise and teaches you a lot about the various components of a standard OS.

However, installing Arch is not  at all difficult. Each step is clearly set out in the instillation guide. You have to set up your keyboard, connect to the internet, partition/formal the disk, set a root password and do some other minor tinkering with user accounts date/time etc then install a boot-loader. After that, you simply install whichever desktop environment you like best (for the majority of users this is either Gnome, KDE-Plasma, XFCE), load in your GPU drivers and you pretty much have a functioning operating system.

Certainly bits are fiddly. Installing the bootloader required some additional learning. You have to know if your computer uses BIOs or UEFI. There may be some later hardware specific trouble shooting. If you want to experiment with unusual desktop environments, you may run into problems. However, after installing it twice (once as a test run in a VM and once on my desktop) my reaction was 'wait is that it?'.

It's certainly more difficult than a normal installer and it does teach you things. I would recommend it as a learning excercise. But there are much much much more complicated and difficult things to configure than Arch. So I was left wondering why people are so proud of their arch installs. If you can read the guide and you have a spare hour, you can install arch! It's less of a challenge than most flatpack furniture, and you don't see people openly boasting about their NYBODA sidetable.

Males are just sperm generators in the grand scheme of nature. That's it.","Yes, we'll use dildos that emit scientifically engineered sperms if we actually want to. But, having men is a burden on the more crucial female role in the society. This is because females are the catalysts of new humans, while males are just eccentric, pointless dependent beings who just fuck any female hole they deem capable of bearing babies, and go on pointless adventures to fulfill their simple evolutionary role of existence. They usually mold these experiences as ""protecting ladies,"" but humans really don't need any of that protection anymore with modern weapons liks guns. Females have an evolutionary purpose, and act like actual humans or a main representative of a species. Males are temporary and non-crucial secondary humans that are there to just spread their genetic materials to normal humans with two pairs of 23 chromosomes and not a weird, discriminating, smaller, and shallower Y chromosome. Without females, it's virtually impossible to generate humanity; breasts, ovaries, and much more are feminine features that cause humanity's progression forwards. This is thanks to the immense genetic information contained within the X chromosome. Same couldn't be said for the very small (but obviously still important) Y chromosome that basically just neutralizes the X chromosome, and creates a simple stick and crude, tiny reproduction cells called sperms. Much less genetic material is needed for males that are highly dependent on females to pass on their genes. This means males act as floor sweepers or truck drivers for spreading these genes in the scheme of evolution. They can easily be replaced by machines. Male lives are a joke in this way. This is not a bad thing, as humans are complex beings though. They have thoughts and ideas that are equally valuable. This is an idea of a male, by the way. Yes, I'm a male. But I realize the fact that crucial human features like breasts and ovaries have been replaced by a simple stick that just emits simple liquids in us, and that the rest of my collaborations to the human race are just limited to my intellect, strength, and labor; which are definitely not lacked by females, but partially compromised during stages like periods or pregnancy. This is not an excuse for male supremacy, and this freedom given to them by having much less of a responsibility in nature is not an explanation for being turned on by random girls and harassing them. Although I will admit, it sometimes feels like my hormones are just designed for that specific purpose, which makes me feel like males are just a parasite species to females that are simply non-crucial and basically, a very primitive way to deal with sexual reproduction.

"CMV: The majority of government economic disaster relief funds should go directly to the consumer, not to corporations.","Whenever there is a major *economic* disaster (as opposed to the natural kinds), financial fear can spread quickly and cause consumers to scale back spending. Cash flow dries up and the economy grinds to a halt. Governments can jumpstart the economy by appropriating funds and injecting liquidity, which acts like financial grease.

Most of relief funding should go directly to individuals and families, not corporations (exceptions follow below). Here's why:  It is far more efficient to rescue an economy by helping the consumer than it is by giving the same amount to corporations. The consumer will spend the money where they need it most, which will incentivize companies to supply those needs and do so efficiently.

Example: Imagine that there are two farms:  One farm raises chickens and produces eggs, and another that only makes artisanal cheese from the rare milk of wild Siberian grass-fed goats. If you give 10 families each $20, they will likely reward the chicken farm with most of that $200, buying their chickens and eggs. But if instead you give each farm $100, the chicken farm producing the product in highest demand at this time will not get the funds they could use to expand their operations, hire additional workers, and better serve the community.

Exceptions: There may be a need to target specific industries, but it should be evaluated for health and safety reasons, not for mere convenience. Hospitals are one example where one can make a reasonable argument that their financial viability serves the public good. Basic utilities and communication utilities such as broadband providers are another example.

Give the relief funds to the consumer and allow them to direct it to the products and services that are the most  valuable for them. The money gets spent and will still go to businesses  and corporations, but this way maintains market efficiencies while still  achieving in the desired outcomes.",2020-03-23 14:05:31,changemyview

CMV: Bailouts of any company in the USA are unnecessary because bankruptcy is efficient,"There's a lot of discussion right now about bailing companies out - especially in industries that are perceived as critical. E.g., there's widespread discussion about the US government bailing out Boeing, or companies in the airline industry. Even less-critical companies like movie theaters are making their best pitch to be bailed out. This view is only about the US bankruptcy system.

I think bailouts are wholly unnecessary because the US bankruptcy system is a very efficient mechanism. Here are the main reasons I think this:

* The bankruptcy process is relatively efficient at identifying which companies should be liquidated and which should be reorganized. Companies like an airline or Boeing would not be liquidated - they would be reorganized.

* Bankruptcy of a company like Boeing is not some scary nightmare. It's merely a process that restructures debt and formalizes the transfer or rights from equity-holders to debt holders. 

* A company like Boeing would emerge from bankruptcy just fine. The equityholders of Boeing would be the ones primarily harmed by a bankruptcy, but the company would continue to operate as a going concern. 

* The only thing a bailout would accomplish is the preservation of equity. A bailout would not help the day to day operations of a company any more than bankruptcy would.

* There's no reason to preserve equity. Bankruptcy is a risk accepted and assumed by equityholders when they bought into the company. They could have decided to risk their capital in a more secure position in the capital structure (like debt), but they chose equity.

CMV: Cats are CUTER then dogs,"As a person who owns neither, I want to declare that cats are much cuter then dogs. (This post isn't about which is a better pet, rather which animal is overall more adorable.)

\-All the cats that I've encountered are very affectionate, will allow me to pet them, and are positively responsive to it.  
\-I'm a smaller person, and have never felt intimidated by the size of a cat.  
\-Cats don't drool all over me, and don't smell bad.  
\-As I mentioned, I've never owned either - but based on pictures of pets (for all intensive purposes, lets  compare baby pets, as babies of most animals are very cute) I have never come accross a picture/video of a kitten that I didn't find adorable. I have found some baby rabbits, baby hamsters, or heck, even baby hedgehogs cute, but I've yet to find a puppy which I have found cute. Idk, maybe because most puppies just seem like a smaller size of their adult form, I don't find them as innocent and vulnerable?  
 \---I also think adult cats are much cuter (on average) then adult dogs. Adult cats are fluffy, and clean, and this goes for most cat species. I don't think most small dogs are cute (I find them yappy and annoying) and if they have long hair like poodles or maltses' I just find them more high maintenance, and am more weary of one being in my personal space, if its not clean. I think bigger dogs are cuter, but for whatever reason, some can look kind of ""boney""/""scrawny"" which subconsciously makes me assess it's health (probably my own personal train of thought, but I've never had that with an adult cat).

"CMV: ""consent"" is fetishized to the point of losing it's meaning","Don't get me wrong, basing a legal system on consent seems like a good idea. But we have to recognize that there are exceptions

1. Sometimes we don't want to allow consenting parties for something that only affects them
2. Sometimes we want to affect someone without their consent

Currently it seems like some people just refuse to accept these. For point 1, there are of course ""age of consent laws"". Supposedly, a person before their 18th birthday just can't consent to having sex with someone older, but at 11:59 PM they magically gain this ability. Interestingly, this can also change by passing country borders! Surely this is absurd. More analytically minded/autistic people sometimes get the impression that maybe sex with children should actually be allowed if consent is really the only way to decide. OK, I guess sometimes people also just try to use this to justify advocating for it. But there really is such an honest, simple and intellectualy sound defense of penalizing such acts! And it's my point 1. We think that a child can be too easily manipulated into consenting, that it will harm them and they'll regret it. But they **are** actually able to consent basically the moment they can speak.   


As for point 2, we have ""implied consent"" for example if a person is lying unconcious on the ground, it's deemed that they ""implicitly"" concenst to trying to make them concious back. But that's just not true! Maybe they ODed cause they wanted to die. Maybe you are violating their bodily autonomy by trying to save them. **BUT THAT'S OK.**   


As I think these examples show, the concept of consent is pushed on things where it just doesn't fit. This makes ""consensual"" diverge to meaning basically ""legally(/morally) allowed"". But there is already a word for that, it's ""legally(/morally) allowed"". Just accept points 1,2 and describe things as they are.",2020-03-23 04:46:55,changemyview
CMV: Coddling people too much hurts their ability to lead healthy adult lives,"I was perusing twitter the other day and came across an adult baby (meaning a male, late twenties to early thirties, dressed in a jumper and dawning a pacifier). He spoke like a baby and typed how I would imagine an infant would type. All the comments on his posts were like ""oh you're so cute baby! Have fun playing with your toys"". Not that this is an indicator of self-worth, but I highly doubt he has a successful career or a bludgeoning group of friends. However, I do think his friends are shitty for not telling him to literally stop being a baby. I am not a psychologist, but I am assuming that this behavior is probably due to him not having a good childhood. However, there has to be some sort of day of reckoning/intervention or there is no way he can live as a functioning member of society. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have a cousin that's about 35 years old. Still lives at home, although he could certainly afford not to. He seems content to stay in his parents basement and play video games and board games with his parents every night, as his friends and relatives have moved away and started their own families. He is very unkempt and smelly. His mom is a huge coddler to the point where I have yelled at her for trying to interfere in my own life (trying to get me not to move away, take less classes at Uni, etc). He does not seem to mind. His parents are reaching their 70s so what happens when they pass away or have to move into assisted living? I can't see how he is going to live a robust adult life if he does not get out of that basement. Now, I can sense he has some sort of social anxiety but how will that get any better doing what he currently does?

&amp;#x200B;

This is not to say I do not have sympathy for those who have social/mental difficulties. I was born on the Autism spectrum and have pretty strong anxiety. However, I have managed to get a good job, travel around the world, create significant relationships, and express myself to others. I know everyones journey is different but if I did not push myself to be independent I would not have done all these things. As my mom is related to my aforementioned Aunt, she has the similar coddling tendencies, which I have resisted and I think I have been better for it.",2020-03-23 03:30:56,changemyview

"CMV: Communism has never, and will never work","Let me start off by saying I don’t automatically dislike you if you are a communist, socialist, anarchist, or really any other political ideology. This is a place for people to act mature and respectful to one another and I intend to follow through with that. 

I also want to clarify immediately that I definitely do not know everything surrounding the complexity of socio-economics (especially economics) of communism, capitalism, or anything else. There will likely be fault in what I say, so please point it out to me. 

So, I personally strongly associate communism with totalitarianism. The reason for this is because many totalitarian states at least claim to be communist or have communist tendencies. Socialized education, medical care, wage, etc etc were all a large part of the rise of many communist/Bolshevik regimes (lennin’s Soviet Union, Mao’s China, North Korea, Cuba, etc.) but this often comes with heavy press censorship, militaristic police-states, and a complete suppression of their failures (famine, disease). As a result, all countries that I can think of that claim to be “communist” are complete totalitarian dictatorships, such as China, DPRK, Laos, Soviet Union, are all not only largely unsuccessful and economically stagnant, but also have objectively worse living standards than the western, capitalist counterparts. Why else would this be the case if it wasn’t for a failure of communism? 

Now, I recognize that this isn’t entirely fair; communism isn’t the antonym of democracy, it is the antonym of capitalism (at least how I understand it). The issue is, it is hard to make that difference with the examples provided. I can’t think of a particularly prosperous communist or ex-communist state today with the one exception of East Germany, but that could easily be the accomplishment of the re-building from west Germany. So yes it isn’t a completely fair, sterile, objective comparison, but the question I would ask is does it need to be given the consistent nature of Communist states? 

I also hear the common counter argument of “true communism has never actually been tried”. To that I would first ask what the definition of “true communism” is, and the answers I get to that question vary so greatly, from something that resembles modern day Canada or Sweden to complete anarchism. It is very evident that there is a great deal of division between the communist supporters of the western world, and that is fair; democrats and republicans don’t all get along just because they both agree on democracy. What I would like to specifically ask the supporters of communism here is what “true communism” means to you, and what you think it means to most people who say it. 

A final note on this subject is that I think this excuse for communism failing internationally is just that; an excuse. We could always argue anything forever with that line of reasoning: “Trump appears to be a failing leader because he hasn’t had enough time to make it better. If we re-elect him for another 4 years it will be better this time.” Or more accurately, “true anarco-capitalism hasn’t been tried, this time it will be better!” My Point is there at least appears to be nothing new brought to the table as far as how to prevent the failures of communism from happening again and again in perpetuity until we re-evaluate it’s relevance? Or to put it more bluntly:

How many more millions of people have to die in order to prove you wrong?

I also often get some flavour of “it isn’t as bad as nazism or fascism”. Now, to my understanding nazism and fascism are not one in the same. And I will agree that nazism is in my opinion the worse option of the two (they caused fewer deaths compared to “communism”, but they were also around not nearly as long, making nazism much more “potent” in terms of death and human suffering. Throw in the conspiracies and racism and you have a mess), however I don’t really see the point in arguing over which ideology is that little bit worse. To me, it is like debating between a firing squad and getting hanged. The point is, I see no reason to split hairs. The point of an ideology is that it should be better than everything else, not just not as bad as the other thing.

So with all of my reasoning I hope you can see why I am at least dubious of modern communism, but again, I don’t hate you for it. I’d love to discuss it further.",2020-03-23 03:03:05,changemyview
"CMV: The ""Donald Bucks"" stimulus payments should have an expiration date so the money is spent and not stashed into savings.","We don't have the full details yet, so we are merely thinking on reddit.  I have the view that whatever the dollar amount is, for the purpose of this discussion we can use $1000, that it should have these  stipulations (at a minimum)

1. It should come on a debit card or some card form of payment on a card that is widely accepted.  That way if the money is not used, it is easy for the government to recoup the funds.

2. It should have an expiration date.  You have say, 1 month, 2 months, 3 months, whatever you want to determine the short term to be.  This ensures that the money is spent in the short term to give the economy the boost it needs.  The purpose of the relief check in part is to give the economy an adrenaline shot in the arm.  Putting an expiration gives individuals a sense of urgency to spend this money.


By putting stipulations, you maximize the ability of people to spend that money to provide the jolt to the economy, whether it is in the form of groceries, rent, utilities, gas, clothing, you name it.

I don't have strong views on this, but I am here to understand what is the best way we can maximize the relief payments to get the best financial when payments are disbursed.",2020-03-23 01:23:08,changemyview

CMV: It's not okay to actively hope for someone's death because they disagree with you politically,"Disclaimer: I'm not really all that political 

Recently, there have been a lot of posts that I've seen that are a little bit way too fucking far. On a currently trending post on r/Liberal, there is a comment made by a user who legitimately said they disowned their father for supporting Donald Trump. Now, I don't know about you, but that's like... going way too far. Like, way, way too far. If you really disown your own fucking father for that, then chances are, you're probably the sicko, not him. I'd understand if he was super abusive, but if he wasn't, then you're honestly just a complete POS.

On the more broad issue at hand, going even further to actively wish someone DEATH is just... bonkers. Just today on r/politics and r/news, people were actively wishing Rand Paul to die. It went so far that the post on r/politics had to be shut down, and there were mass reports on r/news about it. I don't know about you, but according to my basic fucking morals, you probably shouldn't actively hope someone dies because they're on the opposite side of the spectrum.

This same thing happened when Rush Limbaugh announced he had cancer. Once again, people on r/news started WISHING him to die, and a lot of people were actually sad because they wanted him to die in a more brutal or horrific way. Honestly, Rush Limbaugh IS a bit of a scumbag, but also, that's just fucked up. That is legitimately SADISM, and really should not be tolerated.

"CMV: Unless you genuinely believe that laws and/or people to enforce them should not exist, ""ACAB"" is an inaccurate critique of police and thus a bad one for addressing the problematic behavior of some officers or the institution more generally.","There are police officers who, beyond just being good people in their private lives, are good police officers. They do not engage in misconduct and, if they saw another officer engaging in it, would try to get them to stop, report them, arrest them, testify against them, etc. So if ""ACAB"" is meant as a statement against individual police behavior, or the way they don't get punished (they do), or the way they always protect one another (they don't) then it's an inaccurate critique. 

There are also police officers who recognize that the institution of policing generally is pretty screwed up (although I'd also argue it's a bit cheeky to refer to the entirety of police-work as a single ""institution;"" a good officer from a small town department in California isn't linked to a phonebook-beating NYPD cop in any way except broad profession) and use their internal position of power to try to affect change from within (arguably the best position from which to influence said change). So if ""ACAB"" is meant as a critique against the system/institution of policing generally then again it is inaccurate since it is targeting all individual police officers (some of whom recognize the flaws in the system and work to correct them) rather than the system itself. 

The only political position I can imagine in which ACAB is actually an accurate critique of your own goals is if you believe that laws and the mechanisms to enforce them should be totally abolished. If that's your position then sure, all cops are bastards merely by virtue of existing. Although even then it would be much more to the point to make up an initialism condemning laws/law enforcement rather than all police officers. 

As a general rule of thumb it's usually ill-advised to condemn the entirety of any single group, especially if you're trying to make a statement about something other than that groups individuals. If I wanted to make a statement condemning the way some moderate Muslims shelter and cover for radicalized Muslims, or the way that Islam itself as an institution is regressive and retarding human progress then trying to address those concerns with an edgy statement like ""All Muslims Are Bastards"" is inaccurate, doesn't do a good job or encapsulating my actual position, and will perhaps shut down meaningful dialogue I could have had with others about that topic.

CMV: Peer exclusion is not bullying,"I'm finding it hard to understand why social exclusion is called bullying. If the whole class doesn't want to be friends with one child they shouldn't be forced to as long as they're not being deliberately mean or abusive. 

Simply not speaking to someone or not inviting them on group trips isn't bullying, you are allowed to choose who your friends are and who you want to spend time with. I've been socially excluded before and I got around it by learning social skills which my parents never taught me, and I don't consider any of the kids who didn't speak to me before that as bullies. They had their own lives to live and didn't owe me anything. 

Even today, if someone is being annoying or boring I don't have to be friends with them or invite them to hang outs, and just because they're lonely doesn't make it bullying. It's not being mean as long as you don't send them hateful messages or embarrass them. 

Also I'm not talking about deliberately plotting to make one kid feel depressed, I simply mean like if they don't have any friends and are being excluded by their peers, that shouldn't be called bullying.",2020-03-22 21:33:16,changemyview
"CMV: Thursday night meeting with Commissioner Omari Hardy and the Mayor, dispute...","Commissioner Omari Hardy was being silenced after expressing concern as to how the Mayor as a Leader was more concerned with the relationships between a local utility holder instead of looking out for the benefit of the people that support and vote for the very same officials in office making these decisions.

Basically, Mr. Hardy called her out for not acting weeks earlier when they had the chance. 

Mr. Hardy was upset at the Mayor because many people were forced to use their last checks to pay the city for utilities that now, during this controversy, coupled with the loss of jobs, people can no longer afford to pay rent/Bills.

Many people work day to day to pay their bills/rent.  Many people have already lost their jobs.

Many people will feel lost, knowing they won't be able to work in order to pay their bills.

Many businesses have closed and many more will soon follow. We all know it's coming, but how can people effectively prepare for something when their funds have essentially stopped flowing.

The Mayor even told Omari that he was ""finished"" and proceed to go  to recess, claiming he was being a disturbance rather than bringing up pertianent points that were 100% correct.

What I found interesting was that Mr. Hardy was the only man of color on the entire panel.  No one else in that meeting said a word, as if Mr. Hardy was indeed being disruptive...rather than understand that he was speaking on behalf of the very same regular citizens that voted many of them in office.  It was sad to watch to see the amount of blatant ignorance in such a time.  I felt the need to reach out and email Mr. Hardy just to let him know that his points were valid and that many other people regardless of culture/ethnicity are experiencing many of the same financial problems.

CMV: A millionaire is less likely than a billionaire to suck a dick for $1 trillion,"This is based on a debate between my gf and myself. 

We were discussing how many people would refuse to suck a dick for any amount of money whatsoever, and both agreed that the percentage is probably pretty low, probably single digits. I know we both would for the right price, and we both would encourage the other to do so for the right price as well, and we're reasonably well-off. The disagreement comes from the fact that I believe that a billionaire is more likely to suck a dick for a trillion dollars than a millionaire is, and she disagrees. I might do a poor job of representing her arguments, but the crux of it is that Jeff Bezos, for instance, has way more 'fuck you money', and therefore has less need to suck a dick for a trillion dollars compared to somebody who 'only' has $5 million in the bank.

This does make some objective sense from a purely mathematical standpoint, but my counterpoint was that a millionaire is rich and has more than enough, but a billionaire is rich, has more than enough, and also quite possibly fundamentally doesn't understand the concept of 'enough', making them more likely to suck a dick for a huge increase in their wealth. Many millionaires probably fall under this definition too and would suck the dick without hesitation, but the fact is that many upper middle class people who planned well for retirement and are currently in their 70s, living off their retirement savings, while technically millionaires, aren't necessarily cut from the same cloth as billionaire types. Someone with $5 million in the bank has enough, and is possibly even aware of the fact that they have enough, although possibly not. Once someone has hit the point of being worth $1 billion though, they almost by definition either don't understand the concept of 'having enough' or quite simply find the idea to be irrelevant. Anyone with over a billion dollars is already at the point where a 50% or even 90% decrease in their net worth would make zero impact on their day to day quality of life. 

To Bezos, every billion after the first doesn't provide any sort of benefit besides status. He has the most billions, and having the most is the only value that they provide to him directly at this point. So if Bezos, worth a bit over $100 billion, was given the chance to increase his net worth by a factor of ten simply by sucking one dick, I don't think he'd hesitate to do it. Assuming that no one else was given the same offer, it would practically ensure that he remains the richest man in the world for the remainder of his life, which is unlikely otherwise.

My argument is that there would be more internal debate among the 1% than among the 0.0001% when it comes to sucking the dick. I think millionaires would probably 50-50 suck the dick for a trillion dollars, whereas poor people, middle-class people, and billionaires would almost universally suck the trillion dollar dick. I realize this is somewhat of a silly question, but quarantine has fucked with our brains to the point where it feels very serious, and I'm hoping for some good discussion on this issue to help with some of the stir craziness.

"CMV: All underpaid ""essential"" service workers should go on strike during this crisis.","This will undoubtedly piss off a lot of people, but this is one of the rare occasions during which these marginalized professions have the negotiating power necessary to force companies to meet their demands. If amazon warehouse workers went on strike then entire regions would be disrupted. There is no way Amazon will want to let that go on longer than it needs to. Even if Law Enforcement comes to break it up, they cannot fix the issue by simply arresting workers (the labor shortage will still be there). 

The main downside to striking during this time is that it would inconvenience everyone dependent on their services (and disproportionately impact those with disabilities or who otherwise cannot get local supplies). I think the onus would be on Amazon for not accepting the strike demands more than it would be on overworked and underpaid employees. Besides, these categories of workers suffer silently and will continue to suffer silently as soon as the crisis passes--so this may be their best chance at making a positive change.

CMV: Fahrenheit is a far better measure of temperature than Celsius. Fahrenheit is more intuitive and allows for more nuance in the range of temperatures that actually matter to humans on a daily basis.,"When it comes to temperature, there are two things humans often use it for. When checking the temperature outdoors, and for cooking. For cooking both Fahrenheit and celcius do an adequate job, but that's not the case for outdoor temperature, where Fahrenheit is far better. 

Most humans understand that 0 is very little and 100 can be seen as a lot. Because of that, it's fairly intuitive to understand that 0F is very cold, and 100F is very hot. 

The same range from very cold to very hot in celcius is -20C and 40. 

Try explaining to a very young child the temperature on a cold day outside in celcius and you'll first have to teach them negative numbers. Then you'll have to teach them decimals because celcius relies far more in decimals as the difference of one degree is far more drastic than in Fahrenheit. 

Is celcius better for doing math and chemistry? Maybe. I don't know. I don't do that, and neither do 99.9% of humans. So it doesn't matter if it's better there. Let people in that field figure it out. But for the rest of us, Fahrenheit  is clearly more intuitive and allows more nuance in the range of temperatures we deal with every single day.

This is so counterproductive to me and really just expresses how overly sensitive PC and unable to discuss anything they are slightly uncomfortable with Reddit is. 

My main point here is that unless someone is displaying superiority towards another race, their not being racist. Ignorant, maybe. But racism is not simple drawing a line between 2 groups because of skin color, thats just ignorance, racism would be someone saying their race is better then that other race. 

It just makes no sense to me why people get off calling someone racist simply for asking a question or expressing a view point even if that view point is flawed. Stereotyping isn’t wrong because it can lead people to judge others before they know them but regardless it’s still not inherently racist to have flawed view on a group of people (especially if your seeking answers/truth) unless you specifically saying or feeling that you’re race is better.",2020-03-22 14:05:59,changemyview
"CMV: If universities implement pass/fail grading, it must be mandatory.","There is going to be a wave of proposals, petitions, and maybe even protests for pass/fail grading at universities now that a few major colleges have announced they are going that route. Some are making the pass/fail grading optional. Regardless of whether the pass/fail grading system is a good idea, I think making it *optional* is a mistake. When an employer sees on your transcript that you opted into a pass/fail grading system, regardless of your actual reason for doing so, some will assume it was becasue you were doing poorly in the class. You could potentially explain to them that you had difficulties with distance learning, but you would have to get to the point of direct communication first, which in some applications is not easy.

Certainly employers (and graduate programs, medical schools, etc...) know that spring 2020 transcripts will look funky, but the other two options (keep letter grades or mandatory pass-fail) are better in this regard. If you keep letter grades employers can see how much your grades dipped (if at all) in response to stress, which may convey adaptability. If you have mandatory pass/fail, then its a black box whether you were doing well or poorly prior to the move to e-learning. If you have optional pass/fail however, people who have and can keep an A will keep the letter, whereas those who were doing badly, regardless of the reason, will take pass/fail if they can meet the pass cutoff. This means that the ""pass"" pool is a mix of good students hit hard by the circumstances and poor students. The A's (and maybe even B's) will always be better than the passes. I have a feeling that something is missing from this chain of reasoning, but as it stands in my mind an optional pass/fail policy would hurt the people it is trying to help.

CMV: Life has turned out to be a big disappointment.,"Let me preface this with I am not a threat to myself or others. 

I’m just tired of struggling. Existing is exhausting, and to what end? Being forced to play the game for someone else’s benefit? We are rounding the corner on 8 billion people, at a certain point we are going to hit a wall, hard. Maybe that’s the current crisis, maybe it isn’t, but at the end of the day, there is a number of people this planet can support. Is it 10 billion? 20? We’ll hit both of those numbers pretty fucking soon. Can we really consider something precious if there’s 8 billion of it? 

It’s frustrating because it could’ve been so much better, and not with much effort. But people are stupid, awful, and selfish, and that simple fact is what made the most amazing thing that has happened in the known universe become a fucking nightmare. That is unbearable to me.

I had a long conversation with my brother about suicide. I don’t have a plan and I don’t plan on making one- this was mostly academic. There are a few things that keep me going now, but those won’t always be around, and it bothers me that everyone’s big rebuttal to suicide is some flavor of “think of the people around you.” 

I feel like if I don’t want to play the game anymore, I shouldn’t have to. Even if I’m completely healthy. I don’t like this existence. That should be enough. Your inability to deal with your own mortality shouldn’t be my problem, and I resent that you’re making my struggle a proxy for that inability.

CMV: Fundamentalist Evangelicals are to Christianity what TERFs are to Feminism.,"I was raised in an Evangelical church from 2008 to 2013 and afterwards moved away to the *Episcopal Church* as a denomination. I know that people give no craps about denominations, and while I get it, many of these nondenominational churches give off a very fundie vibe about things like...

* Earth is literally 6,000 years old.
* The Bible says that there are literally two and only two genders.
* Homosexuality is an ""abomination"" because *the Bible says so*.
* Masturbation is a sin.
* Transitioning from one gender to another is a sin.
* Spare the rod and you spoil the child.
* *""Anyone who disagrees with my hard-line stances about following Jesus is a 'lukewarm Christian's that God will be disappointed with'.
* *God is going to judge you and your heretical church, not me. Take it up with Him, and don't shoot the messenger.*

"CMV: It would be a good compromise to require universal background checks on all firearm purchases, while also implementing a 50 state, shall issue concealed carry permit. If you have the permit, no background check would be required for the actual firearm purchase.","The main argument against universal background checks is that it creates a defacto federal gun registry, which is thought by many to help the federal government to confiscate firearms if it ever decides to.

Most gun owners would prefer to sell a gun to a person they know is not a criminal.

The 50 state concealed carry permit would require a background check and some safety training, like most state permits currently. It would be shall issue, meaning that it will be issued to anyone meeting the requirements.

Once you have the permit, it could be displayed in lieu of the typical background check for a firearm purchase. This is already policy in some states. If you commit a crime worthy of revoking your permit, it is taken from you.

This is easy for private sellers to check. It would close the ""loopholes"" that gun control advocates are against.

I do not believe that this would cause any more violence issues in the states in which it is currently very difficult to legally carry a firearm.

"CMV: ""Real-Time With Pause"" Video Games Are Poor Game Design","Everyone (mostly) knows and loves games like Baldur's Gate and the Total War series -- all of them allow the player to play entirely in real time but also allow the player to pause. For reasons of story and all such, I'd really love to play these games. Problem? I simply can't abide RTwP games.

My main criticism is one of developer intention. Playing a RTwP game entirely as Real Time \[Total War has a Legendary mode like this, I believe\] is usually very hard, while plenty of games designed for Real Time are balanced quite well for it. Playing a RTwP game with frequent pausing is simply emulating a turn-based game, without staggering actions into turns. It's usually easier and more fluid, but it rather feels like cheating. Had the developer intended one or the other extreme, they'd have made the game to fit that extreme. Instead, by combining two extremes, it just feels uncomfortable. Am I playing things the way they're intended by pausing more? Am I being overly-cautious and paranoid? Brazen? Those doubts easily lead to (for me) not enjoying the game. Anything that leads to not enjoying a game is poor game design.

Flow is another concern. Even if one finds a perfect medium of babysitting their characters and units and letting the animation play, the view is still start-stop. One can at least bask in their army charging forth in an RTS game, or rest quietly between turns in a TBS game -- in a RTwP game, one has to constantly be jamming the space bar to freeze time. Animations hang still, and the game feels more like a movie-maker that's intended to be recorded and replayed at the end. Every time I touch a game that even resembles this approach, I immediately wonder if it'll be one where battles take hours -- or minutes. Should I allocate my time to play this one way, or another? No other game forces you to set your pace in such a way -- they allow it, but they don't force it.

Finally, I find that the details of individual characters/units in RTwP games tend to be slightly nebulous as a result of the system. In Baldur's Gate, one's actions have a cooldown (if I'm remembering right). One can't just mash the button and watch everything die. Problem is that choosing abilities and feats and such deals with the abilities. If I pick Feat A, does it benefit me most when I'm moving fast and frequently cycling through abilities? Will Feat A punish me for playing slowly and being less attentive? Will Feat B be any different? These are questions the players have to ask -- and I understand that some may like making those choices. My problem is that these choices deal more with player skill and desire to relax than other games. I know I wouldn't go into a Command and Conquer match with the same expectations as a Civilization V game -- in one, my own skill and speed is relevant in a consistent manner. In the other, I am allowed to relax without worrying that my speed makes a difference (my computer's speed does, though ;|). In a RTwP game, I have to try and find some balance. My favorite balance may not mesh with what I want to do, story-wise or visually or whatever.

These reasons are why I don't think RTwP games are good design. The rest of all these games is wonderful, though -- that's my problem. Gamers -- Change My View!",2020-03-22 01:36:27,changemyview
CMV: The exodus from the Torah is historically false. None of the exodus events actually happened.,"The academic consensus is that the exodus events are historically false, they’re just a myth. There was no enslavement of Jews in Egypt, no living in the desert for 40 years, no Israelite genocide against the natives in Canaan and stealing their land to form Israel.  if you want to read about it, here are a few links [1](https://books.google.com/books?id=0QHHITXsyskC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false) [2](https://books.google.com/books?id=Qjkz_8EMoaUC&amp;newbks=0&amp;hl=en) [3](https://books.google.com/books?id=6-VxwC5rQtwC) 

Instead, historians think that either the Hyskos (not the Jews) were dictators and ruled over Egypt, until they were overthrown and kicked out) or the Canaanites (some of whom became the Jews) living in Canaan (not Egypt) felt mistreated by the Egyptians (not enslaved let alone the rest of the exodus mythology). Neither theory has any slavery or Jews, let alone slavery of millions of Jews for generations in Egypt, living in the desert, genocide, stealing land, etc.

CMV: Time must exist outside of our universe,"I have often been told by folks who have studied physics that time is entirely and exclusively a property of our physical time-space universe, and that time does not and cannot exist outside of it. That is to say, time is an exclusive and integral property of this universe and (specifically) time does not and \*cannot\* exist beyond that.

My contention with this has always been that, if the Big Bang (or Big Bounce, or something similar) actually occurred, then it must have occurred on ""some"" timeline; it's illogical to say that it occurred on ""our"" timeline, since time is relative to space per Einstein's theory of relativity, and time ""didn't start until the Big Bang"".

To put it another way: how is it possible that this universe came into being without a timeline or other 'sequential/causal field' within which that coming-into-being occurred? Indeed, the phrase ""come into being"" itself implies and necessitates a timeline, upon which events can occur in a particular order.

One hypothetical explanation/possibility (from my current viewpoint) is that our universe, and perhaps some other universes, exist within some kind of ""meta universe"", which itself has its own timeline - and within which individual sub-universes such as ours periodically go through Big Bang/Bounce events, with each having their own \*internal\* timeline. When I suggest this to my physics-minded friends they insist that this viewpoint doesn't make sense (though none have been able to articulate exactly why, given my above reasoning). And my view, of course, is that it MUST be the case that some ""outer"" timeline exist, for a Big Bang event to have occurred at all.

CMV: The United States should scrape the current representative system and go to direct democracy,"When the time the Constitution was written and the United States was founded  it may have been a good idea to have representatives to send to a  central location to decide public policy, but the world is different  now.  The ability to travel and communicate afforded to us changes the  game.  The old way is archaic, slow and flawed.  Not only are there many  laws passed that are contrary to the majority view (undemocratic), but  the length of time it takes to pass even the most mundane stuff is  detrimental to society's advancement.  Furthermore, it would allow  people to vote on individual laws rather than ""packages"" with many  unrelated provisions that are slipped in last minute before anybody has  had a chance to read it.  It would also limit or eliminate the need for  the judiciary, which is often even slower than the legislative process  and decided upon by single unelected officials (judges) serving long  (sometimes lifetime) terms.

This  could all be done with the Internet or even phone app; although the  exact method of technology is not really important to my view.  To  combat a few counter arguments:  security/hacking concern and the  average person does not know enough about complex issues to have a good  opinion.  Security/Hacking concern:  I believe some states are vote by  mail only so how easy is it to just open somebody's mail and change  their vote or what about the fact that many banks, medical, academic,  and other companies allow you to access personal information online.  If  they can secure that, why can't they secure votes. The average person  does not know enough about complex issues:  First, you would not have to  vote on every issue. Second, many reps who currently vote or influence  the members of congress (lobbyists, policy advisors, etc) may know a lot  about an issue but have a biased or subjective view that hurts the  average/vast majority of Americans.

CMV: People whose incomes are not affected by the current virus measures should not get government assistance.,"The government is currently on course to mail out checks to *everyone* under certain income caps.  Yet there are still many people whose incomes haven't been affected, even by the ""stay at home"" orders.  

Government employees, including teachers, are still being fully paid.  Many employees of businesses are still being paid.  Others are able to work from home and get fully paid.  And others are still working in the supply chain, medical and ""essential"" industries and are getting bonuses and overtime.

If the government targeted assistance to those who need it the most, they could do *more* for any given dollar amount than a general benefit that goes to everyone.  If these measures are not implemented, then there are probably other factors involved (i.e. a desire to curry favor and popularity with upset voters, more general beliefs about income distribution in general that should be addressed separately etc.)

To those who suggest it would be impractical to accomplish this in a short amount of time, I would suggest that the adjustment should be made on 2019 tax filings.  If your income is above a certain amount (say, $30,000 individually or $60,000 jointly), and your income for 2019 was equal to or greater to 2018, then you pay an additional tax equal to the benefit.",2020-03-21 18:41:08,changemyview
CMV: After a Certain Point You did not Earn that Wealth,"So as a general rule if you want to find out how wealthy someone is and how much money they make the three things you want to know are how educated someone is, how intelligent they are and how hard they work. In general in most western nations which provide free education seem to follow this trend. 

However there comes a point at which outsized wealth becomes completely unjustified. Taking a relatively simple example of Jeff Bezos, a man whose services I use daily. Yes this man designed a good product and to an extent he should be rewarded. But that he is now a multi billionaire for helping code something in the late 90's which had multiple competitors is patently absurd. It is highly likely that if Jeff didn't make amazon someone else would have and they'd now be the multi billionaire. Especially considering most change in management and oversight has shifted away from Jeff and towards managers.

CMV: Guns are not at the root of America’s violence problems,"As a Canadian we tend to look down on America for the gun violence problem they have, however stats are often misrepresented to make it seem far worse than it is.  Most of the gun deaths are suicides, and most of the murders occur in big cities, where gangs target rival gangs, and the rest of the citizens are largely unaffected.

This being said, I would stipulate that A) people who are going to commit suicide will jump off a bridge, or use a belt if guns were to go away (Canada has suicides too, despite our gun control). B) gang violence will occur with or without guns; look at London, England’s knife problems. C) preventing the sale of guns to law abiding citizens will not prevent gun crimes, nor will it stop guns from falling into the hands of criminals because D) criminals will find a way to obtain firearms regardless, whether they steal them, have them trafficked in from another nation, or falsify a background check.

Furthermore, firearms are necessary for the safety of many rural dwellers who may need to deal with coyotes attacking livestock, or bears in the yard. Rural firearm ownership is common in Canada and has not contributed to a violence problem. Ergo, it seems there is something fundamentally broken in American culture regarding violence and crime, and the use of guns in these crimes is incidental, not causal.

CMV: Theodore Roosevelt's presidency &amp; character should not be admired,"Firstly, I do not consider Theodore Roosevelt to be America's 'worst' leader, nor am I arguing from a biased viewpoint about how \[x leader\] was better. In terms of US history, only few presidents hold universally enormous cults of personality and Theodore is included. Therefore, I want to suggest how ill-informed this actually is by raising an argument against his alleged 'divine' leadership.

Roosevelt was strongly anti-socialist, aggressively nationalist and disputed any assistance toward civil rights directly contrasted toward his predecessors. In my opinion, his interventionist and imperialist motivation throughout US politics is heavily linked alongside many of America's worst military decisions. His 'Roosevelt Corollary', which asserted a disgusting ""right"" to essentially become the world police force. Additionally, he was often creating conflict between many progressive groups, including anti-racist advocates and feminists. Theodore's advisers insisted upon awful pro-business actions. His first address to congress, which preceded the 'Immigration Act of 1903', is no exception from this belief:

\&gt;I earnestly recommend to the congress that in the exercise of its wise discretion it should take into consideration the coming to this country of anarchists or persons professing principles hostile to all government. ... They and those like them should be kept out of this country; and if found here they should be promptly deported to the country whence they came.

Conclusively, as recognised, Theodore Roosevelt may not be America's worst president and absolutely held some positive intentions (i.e. his moderate trust busting or conservationism)... although the cult of personality he possesses throughout should be scrutinised.",2020-03-21 15:39:00,changemyview
CMV: there is nothing wrong with ‘ghosting’ someone you have no formal relationship with.,"Obviously this opinion depends on a lot of factors like time, nature of informal relationship, situation, etc. 

I see a lot of posts on dating subs of people being accused of being amoral, cowardly or just generally bad people for not informing someone when they lose interest after a few dates. I don’t believe people are entitled to an explanation of why someone no longer wants to spend time with them if there isn’t an established relationship there, the absence of contact is the only indication you need and your frustration is with the fact things aren’t progressing how you want them to rather than the act of ghosting.

There’s a few reasons why I think this. Firstly, you’re exposing yourself to a potentially severely negative reaction from someone who is more or less a stranger. You’re also having to take on their emotional weight from a decision out with your control by having that conversation with them. 

The most common argument I see for this is that it’s just good manners and that an explanation, even to a stranger, is as much of a common courtesy as holding a door open. I think this is a false equivalence because common courtesies don’t require emotional investment, stressing over what to say, and potentially negative consequences. 

This seems like a popular opinion and it’s one I’ve never heard a good reason for holding aside from being a natural emotional reaction to rejection, so I’m interested in hearing the arguments against ghosting.",2020-03-21 15:01:46,changemyview

It is a fair comparison to make by comparing this to when Marie Antoinette allegedly said ""Let them eat cake"". People are losing their jobs, and dying because they can't get tested or afford quality healthcare. Celebs are saying ""We are all in this together""...um no. You are fenced off in your 20,000 sq. ft. house with testing and quality healthcare at the drop of your hat. Everyday people aren't sure if they will have a job by the end of this week. Kids aren't sure if they will be returning to school before the summer. We are not in the same situation, and you should not be comparing your situation to ours",2020-03-21 13:46:59,changemyview
CMV: I prefer peeing outside to inside,"I discovered peeing outside when I was about 3 years old and my family was on a road trip. I had to pee so my parents stopped the car and I started peeing next to a bush. The smell of the evergreens and the damp soil beneath my feet were my dream peeing spot from then.
I find peeing outside way more exciting. I am 13 by the way. Even now I use cycling trips around the city to pee in secluded parts in the parks. Once I even peed in an alley. I try my best to be as hygienic as possible and use toilets when I have to but I use every chance I get at home to pee in the lawn.

CMV: Not adopting from a shelter or not neutering your pets is evil.,"We need to adopt cats/dogs because there are too many in shelters being  put down. Bringing more animals into the world is only making the  problem worse. Every good boy/girl deserves a home - not a death  syringe.

I believe that breeding  dogs as a job is evil and causes dogs to die, be it in a puppy mill or a  home breeder, both are either ignorant or evil. I've voluntreerred at animal shelters hoping for my favourite good boy/girl to be adopter but insted people just want pretty looking pets.

And what's the difference between racism and believing one breed is better than the other? A mutt can be smarter and more friendly than a Border Collie. What's more is that a lot of dog breeds are made to make the dog look pretty at the expense of the dog's well being, like pugs who have trouble breathing.

And don't give me the argument that if we neuter our dogs then dogs/cats will go extinct, but that's unrealistic and stupid. When animal shelters stop needing to euthanise pets, THEN we can stop neutering.",2020-03-21 11:58:14,changemyview

CMV: Corporations shouldn't get public bailouts unless their stock price is effectively zero,"As I understand it, corporations get bailouts because they need an influx of cash to stay solvent. And I see the logic -- corporations suddenly ceasing to exist may have a huge social cost, and a bailout may be better for all of us.

But in most cases, it seems like there's a fairer way to get an influx of cash: create more shares and sell them to the public. The result is that existing shares will get diluted, so the money will come from exactly where it should: existing investors, rather than the general public.

If the situation is bad enough, the share price may drop effectively to zero. If that happens, I can get behind a government bailout in certain situations. But if that's not the case, is there any reason to prefer a government bailout, other than the fact that our government loves giving money to rich people?",2020-03-20 03:20:52,changemyview

CMV: Technocracy is a much more efficient and moral form of government than a Representative Democracy.,"My argument lies on three predicates.

1. The morality of a government lies in the service of the constituents rather than the way that service is delivered. The quality of life provided by the system is more relevant to it's morality than the feeling that the average citizen is represented.

2. The average citizen neither cares about government nor should they be expected to. The voting rate of the U.S. has hovered right above 50% for most of it's history and even out of those who do vote a significant portion are simply regurgitating information that has not been through a critical thought process. However, this is to be expected. Policy is not simple nor could it be simple. It takes a concerted effort and an extensive education to understand the far reaching effects policy can have. The average person is simply to busy to have the time to get the required education to make a responsible decision on policy or on the people who should make decisions on policy.

3. A Technocratic government takes the responsibility of expertise off of the people and places it on the most educated among us. It would also provide a better quality of life to the people through implementing new technologies and to have a guiding hand in progress toward the future.",2020-03-19 22:09:47,changemyview
CMV: All self-proclaimed Christians are hypocrites at best and murderers at worst.,"Now, let me preface this by saying that those are fairly well-known Bible quotes, and I'm not the *most* knowledgeable on it. If you can prove me wrong using the Bible, more power to you.

First, I guess we have to start by assuming that the Bible is true. I personally don't think it is, but I can't imagine there exists a Christian in the world who thinks that the Bible is fake, that would be rather off-brand.

Let's start by looking at Matthew 5:18 and subsequent verses, which is presented to be a direct quote of Jesus, aka literally God as the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit all seem to be just three aspects of the same entity.

&gt; 18 For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.

Which seems like he is saying you have to respect all of the entire Bible at all times, which presumably includes the Old Testament.

Next, have a look at Deuteronomy 21:18-21

&gt; 18 If a man have a stubborn and rebellious son, which will not obey the voice of his father, or the voice of his mother, and that, when they have chastened him, will not hearken unto them:

&gt; 19 Then shall his father and his mother lay hold on him, and bring him out unto the elders of his city, and unto the gate of his place;

&gt; 20 And they shall say unto the elders of his city, This our son is stubborn and rebellious, he will not obey our voice; he is a glutton, and a drunkard.

&gt; 21 And all the men of his city shall stone him with stones, that he die: so shalt thou put evil away from among you; and all Israel shall hear, and fear.

So basically if your son is an alcoholic, you *have to* publicly torture him to death.

Pay special attention to the word *shall*, not *should*, which is the same word used in the ten commandments, more specifically the first one, also in Deuteronomy 5:7.

&gt; 7 Thou shalt have none other gods before me.

So if you believe that the Christian God is the one true God, you also have to believe that alcoholics need to be publicly tortured to death.

Or the other way round, if alcoholics deserve to live, since the same word structure in the same book is used for the ten commandments, that also means that the Christian God isn't actually the one true god, and there is nothing stopping me from sacrificing goats for the glory of Odin and trying to find out things about the future by divination and burning bone shards, which means the whole religion is pointless anyway.

Hence, hypocrites at best and murderers at worst.

"CMV: 'ACAB' is not only incorrect, but goes to invalidate the purpose for the movement behind the mantra: Police reform.","To start, the 'All cops are Bastards' mantra is based on the idea that not only are all law enforcement officers a negative influence on American society, but that law enforcement as a whole in the US is corrupt, biased, and ineffective. While I do have caveats (see below), I think that it is this exact same rhetoric that will make it virtually impossible to  enact wide sweeping police reform as a whole.


I will certainly concede that there are some significant problems within law enforcement within the United States- after all, statistics on drug crimes and their ineffectiveness on the War on Drugs discrimination in policing, and problems of police accountability due to the 'thin blue line' (among other things) are problems that need to be addressed by local, state, and federal governments. It is absolutely clear that law enforcement reform is necessary for the country.

However, taking a stance such as 'ACAB' is not only alienating, but politically foolish. There are approximately over 800,000 sworn officers of the United States, and not all officers are so called bastards. This alienates a group of people who are instrumental in making that change itself- the police officers and their respective departments. No one wishes to work with people who not only do not see eye to eye with them, but insult them in the same breath.


To pull out the microscope a bit further, this also alienates anyone who does not toe this clear line between 'liking' police officers and 'hating' them, when it's more of a muddied feeling- there are certainly many who aren't a fan of cops, but understand that law enforcement is critical to a stable community. If the goal of those following the 'ACAB' mantra is to get rid of law enforcement entirely, keep it. It delineates where one stands on not only the idea of cops, but whether they are important to society, because 'ACAB' is pretty cut and dry. However, if the goal is to achieve reform at all levels of enforcement, a more nuanced approach is needed for a nuanced issue.",2020-03-19 21:50:08,changemyview

CMV: Only the best and brightest should major in the humanities,"Forum posts and news articles trying to dissuade people from trying to major in the humanities (and promoting ""STEM education"") are ubiquitous, but so are various attempts to defend the humanities/a liberal education (these usually talk about non-vocational skills like ""critical thinking"").

As a fifth year PhD student who has spent nearly a decade in academia, I've interacted with a lot of humanities students, both undergrad and grad.  In undergrad I double majored in linguistics and CS at a selective university, and nearly all my friends were humanities majors (mostly linguistics, but also English, philosophy, history, etc.)  I've encountered basically two kinds of humanities student -- those just want a college degree and don't know what to major in, but don't want to do anything technical (&gt;80%), those who are passionate about the field they're studying but aren't very good students (~10-15%) and those are both passionate and very good (&lt;5-10%).  

In the US, where even non-selective institutions charge tens of thousands of dollars a year, it makes no sense at all to coast through a non-vocational major if you don't know what you want to do with your life.  If you're at a no-name school and an average student, you shouldn't be majoring in English -- you're very unlikely to get into a top law school, you're not being funneled to the top consulting programs...you're basically setting yourself up for hardship.  Major in accounting, nursing, even a generic vocation degree like ""business""...or go to a vocational school and become a tool and die maker.  

Even though I was near the top of my class in my linguistics undergrad (and just somewhat above average at CS) I decided to do a PhD in CS and focus on a linguistics-adjacent area (NLP) when I saw linguistics PhDs at my school (who were among the best students in the world at one of the best programs, and much smarter and harder-working than me) struggle to find jobs related to their field after graduating.  For most of them, though, it was clearly worth it -- they contributed meaningfully to their field, scratched an itch they would never be able to scratch if they didn't do it in their 20s, and still got pretty interesting jobs.   These students are the best of the best, and I just don't think it's worth it for the rest.  (I actually think the same actually applies to the sciences, where a bio major who doesn't get into med school doesn't have a lot of options to pay off their debt...but that's another story).

I understand that outside the US college can be quite inexpensive or even free, and pursuing what you enjoy (even if you're not great at it) for four years is probably worth it...most jobs nowadays require a college degree, even if only to validate that you have decent written communication skills.  But if you're taking out tens of thousands in student loans to major in philosophy and not *absolutely crushing it* with the goal of an awesome LSAT score or a high-paying consulting job, I think you're making a terrible mistake.",2020-03-19 19:31:38,changemyview

The mom is the asshole. Your girlfriend is trying to manipulate you. Women lie all the time. This one woman did X horrible thing, so all women might do X horrible thing. There’s just something about her I don’t like; I can’t put my finger on it, but I hate her. You can’t trust women. What a slut. She just wants attention. I bet she’s single. Men get raped more. Men have harder jobs. That’s why you’re single. Men don’t care about that issue, so women shouldn’t either. It’s MY BABY, too; who cares what she wants? I’m not like other girls. You’re crazy; I would never treat my boyfriend that way. Western women are spoiled dykes with no respect for men. I don’t bang 5s. Women owe me respect. Blah blah blah.

CMV: A dictatorship with an empathic and caring leader is better than democracy.,"Disclaimer: English is not my native language.

I recently thought about what the disadvantages/advantages of a dictatorship are and came to the conclusion that dictatorships have so far failed solely because of their kleptocratic, discriminatory and self-centered leaders. If you look at the advantages of a dictatorship, you will immediately notice a few things. 
- Thanks to central control, decisions can be made very quickly. Military defense functions in a controlled manner, election campaigns no longer play a role in decision-making, and unnecessary debates do not stop decision-makers.
- Racism, sexism, anti-Semitism or xenophobia are not the product of a single leader. On the contrary, a dictatorship can even slow down group-related hatred. If the majority of a society is racist, it chooses racist politicians. In Poland, where I have my roots, we see, for example, how a very right-wing conservative government receives full support from the population. A dictator who rejects attacks on groups could fight homophobia or racism, which a popularly elected government cannot. - Identifying with the dictator can create a better community. Everyone looks for identification, whether it's a soccer club, their hometown, their nation or their favorite band. Group formation brings with it exclusion of those who think differently, which would be bad. Here, in particular, a dictator could satisfy the general need for identification and proactively ensure that outsiders are not seen as enemies. This ""directed formation of an identity"" would unite the country, fight enemy images of ""others"" and give meaning to the lifes of people.
- A humanist dictator doesn't need to fear the press and freedom of expression. Of course there would be a state press and politicians who cannot be voted out by the people. However, private newspapers and freedom of expression should not scare such a government and they could still exist. Only those who act in such a way that their people can become angry must fear the press, not those who guarantee all citizens a life of peace and freedom.
Did I think wrong here somewhere? I'm looking forward to your counter arguments.

Here are some answers in advance, as I expect certain questions.

Dictatorships have always been bad. They would become victims of their leader's lust for power and oppression.
A: That may be, but I am not arguing for the introduction of a dictatorship. I only claim that the concept of dictatorship is superior to the concept of democracy in terms of unity, capacity to act and general satisfaction. I certainly don't defend any of the gruesome real dictatorships like the Third Reich, the Soviet Union or Pinochets Chile.

What would happen if people had a different opinion?
A: People have the right to have a different opinion than the state. Criticism may be expressed in the form of the dictatorship that I am thinking of, but the decision to change something rests solely with the dictator.

What form of rule do you mean by ""dictatorship""? 
A: A rule in which the central power lies with one person. This person deploys courts, military and economic advisors at his will. Social freedom would be modeled on Western Europe, while no elections are held. The social system would also be based on the European model, a social market economy with social assistance and health insurance.",2020-03-19 16:49:21,changemyview

"CMV: Utilities, such as water or electricity should be made socialized free of charge","So the two main issues with nationalization is that a) it could result in lower quality products/services due to lack of competition and b) it may not be the most efficient allocation of resources, again because the lack of competition, means the government doesn’t have any incentive to make the service most efficient.

Even with this in mind, we should nationalize public utilities and make them available free of charge. Doing this would that low income families in particular wouldn’t have to worry about paying water or gas bills, and could make use of those resources. I recognize this may mean that the service isn’t *as* good as possible, and may not be as efficient as possible, but to me even somewhat inefficient public spending is worth it if it provides the most good to the most disadvantaged in society.

I have heard the common argument for privatization is that it would result in lower taxes, meaning that the working class would have more cash to afford to buy utilities from private contractors, but taxes are going to actaully burden the rich far less, who can afford to finance society with their excess wealth.

CMV: American cruise ship companies that get bailout money should only receive it based on the percent of capacity of passengers or number of ships registered/flagged to the United States,"First, I don't think cruise line should get bailout money- they aren't an essential service like airlines, but putting that to the side, and taking it as a given that they will be provided funds, I think it should be based on the number of ships, or the ratio of tourist capacity of their ships, that are actually registered in the United States. If they are [registered in the Bahamas or Panama](https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/cruises/2012/12/11/why-are-cruise-ships-registered-in-foreign-countries/1760759/), then they need to seek redress from those countries.

&amp;#x200B;

Consider it like this-

A small cruiseline, Sneakyboats, has 3 ships, A, B, and C with the following registry and capacities:

* A - Bahamas - 1,500 passengers
* B - Bahamas - 1,000 passengers
* C - United States - 500 passengers

Based on the number of ships, Sneakyboats could receive 1/3 their bailout claim.

Based on the capacity, Sneakyboats would receive 1/6th the amount.

CMV: What is today the Kaliningrad Oblast should have been made into a Jewish homeland after World War 2,"After WW2, parts of Germany were annexed into nearby countries, the region of Prussia for example was split between a Polish South and a Russian (at the time Soviet) North. I think the Northern part should have been made into a Jewish homeland instead of Israel and here are my reasons :

1. After WW2 a large exodus of the East Prussian German population, the land was empty and it would eventually be filled with Russian settlers so ""a land without a people for a people without a land"" as the famous Zionist saying goes.
2. The establishment of a Jewish homeland on previously German soil would have been considered as a form of ""reparations"" to Jews after the Holocaust.
3. Russia wouldn't get a Baltic exclave that would be a source of major conflict today, especially for its Baltic neighbors and Poland.
4. The issue with Palestine would be solved as there would be no Zionist state (though calls for such a state would still probably exist
5. The German identity of the the region would be kept as most of the Jewish population that would settle would have been Yiddish speakers (basically a German dialect).

Now I do recognize some problems would have existed, many Zionists didn't want any land but specifically Palestine (which is something I disagree with but that's for another time) but in the large scheme of things, it would have been beneficial for everyone including Jews, Russians, Poles, Balts, Arabs and Germans.

"CMV: There's no ""proper"" way to determine sovereignty of a land","According to wikipedia, the right of conquest were the main legal right of ownership before WW2. Basically, you conquered a land and signed a peace treaty with the original owner, the land is yours. That is probably the justification for most nations today, but of course, people don't like it.

I thin the Asian way was the mandate of heaven, but it was still pretty much whoever won got the land. 

Then the Europeans invented the Doctrine of discovery, basically allow Europeans to claim land that did not belong to Europeans. Not sure anybody support it right now. Other people argue that whoever first discover a land owns it, which also doesn't seem to work since there's no clear definition of discovery.

Then we have self-determination, which means the people who live on the land can vote. However, there's no clearly definition of ""people"". Some people say it has to be the first people who live on the land, some say it's the current population. But who are the first people who lived on the British islands? Who are the current population of NA?

CMV: It's unfair that Fiber Optic Wifi is not available in some regions,"People claim Fiber Optic Internet is the future. First of all, how can something considered apart of the world's future lose accessibility to such a vast majority of the globe? By acknowledging this we can conclude that it's a work in progress.

With Fiber optic internet not accessible to developing countries, it will slow down our online work completely compared to those who do have it set up. This is why you encounter players who glitch out of a lobby or server constantly. 

It can cost thousands of hours. A 70 gigabyte download using my 3 mbps internet would take me 4 days if I'm lucky and do not encounter any errors. It will wear down my internet and take up its bandwidth to others who are using it. 

If Fiber optic Internet were accessible to more countries then big projects which require different crowds and people from all over the world would take less time and issues/difficulties along the journey. In short it will connect our bonds, adding new improvements and research faster. 

Yes, it is costly and surely not achievable in the blink of an eye. Leaders and technologists aren't focusing on this subject as much as they think they are.

CMV: politicians that win elections do so by simply appealing to people who don't necessarily know or care much about politics,"Politics is never about who is the best candidate, it's always about appealing to idiots, people who don't care about politics and people who can't be bothered to learn about it. 

In the UK, most people will vote for the same party each time which is usually the party that their parents voted for. Then there are a small percentage who are willing to change their vote depending on which candidate they prefer. The thing is, it's almost always the candidate that is the most charismatic that wins, not necessarily the one with the best ideas. 

Most people ultimately do not understand what they're voting for. They do not understand the other side of the argument. I see in political subreddits all the time people who are completely ignorant of the arguments for the other side. They just have blind hatred for the other side and see them as some evil boogeyman that has bad intentions. Most political systems have good intentions, the debate is whether those good intentions will actually happen under the system. Politics shouldn't be about us Vs them. 

The average person can be swayed to vote for a party that completely opposes all their principles if that party is packaged in the right way or their campaign focusses on the right talking points. An example is the conservative party in the UK winning in areas that have only ever voted labour since records began simply because Boris Johnson spouted a load of charismatic bullshit about getting brexit done. 

Who wins an election is simply about which party happens to have the best leader I.e the most likeable and charismatic leader. It has nothing to do with the shifting values and principles of the country, it has nothing to do with what is best for the country - it's just which party is lucky enough to have a talented leader who knows how to appeal to the average person. 

This post sounds very anti right wing (which is probably because I'm generally left wing) but for fairness I'll say the left does it as well. Socialist parties tend to win votes by making grandiose promises which are financially unfeasible. A socialist party isn't going to win by saying ""oh yeah we'll have not as many benefits for a bit but then once we've accumulated some wealth well start to do things like write off student loan debt"".

In cases of children I would generally say no, especially if they are not teenagers, though I’m sure there would be exceptions. 

There comes a point where life is no longer worth living and is unbearable. I don’t see why someone who lives a life wanting to die every single day but can’t die shouldn’t be considered for euthanasia when in countries like the Netherlands, it is permitted.

"CMV: When making friends in the K-12 school system or even in college, it’s better to look for people with similar interests/activities/social skills than purely based on academic achievements.","Most kids or college students don’t really identify themselves and group themselves based on any academic credentials. You see students sitting next to each other at lunch or hanging out after school based more on their outside interests or activities. The baseball team or football team hangs out as teammates, but you don’t really see the Honors English class hanging out together because they are all in the same class. A person’s self identity and social interests are based on things outside of the classroom, not inside of it. 

When spending time outside of the classroom, conversations are more based on personal experiences, other friends or classmates opinions on things, etc, than discussing what your teacher or professor lectured about in class that day. At a younger age, you identify with your fellow peers more than your teacher who may be twice or three times your age. You want to know how your friends or classmates feel about the trendy TV show, music group, school dance, etc. Getting good grades is important, but once school is done  for the day, your focus is more on what your fellow students are all talking about. 

At least in the elementary and middle school grade levels, you’re not really thinking about jobs or career paths yet. Most students have the same classes and maybe one elective per year. There’s no real need to socialize based on academic interests. Even at the high school grades, students identify with their peers based on being in the same club/committee/sport or even based on romantic/dating interests than purely on academics/GPA. 

Extracurricular clubs and sports also allow you to work with others as a team. You and the other students are working together for a common goal or achievement. With academics, most grades are based on individual activities. You can’t take an exam or test as a group, each student is doing it separately. This limits the ability to create a bond with your peers. Even if you study together, you can’t actually take the exam together. There’s a limitation to how much you can work collaboratively. 

Basically, people choose to hang out with those who enjoy doing the same things as them. If you like the same sport, those teammates are your friends. If you like music, your band mates are your friends. Even having similar views on personal or romantic relationships allow you to have in depth conversations and sharing of feelings and emotions with people who you identify with.",2020-03-19 07:13:15,changemyview
"CMV: It's unreasonable that the U.S. is still getting so much flak over its invasion of Native American land 400 years ago, especially as Native American tribes did the same to predecessor tribes","Something I've always wondered about is why there are still Buzzfeed-esque videos of people decrying the U.S. for killing and stealing the land of Native American tribes. It was terrible, it was war, it was colonization, it was invasion, there is no denying that.

But then I always wondered: who did the Native American tribes take that land from? I found out they were pillaging, torturing and raping women of defeated enemy tribes before taking over that land. They were hardly a peaceful, coexisting society minding their own business before these evil men came and killed them for no reason. The colonials arrived accidentally on North American soil, and started expanding and setting down their camps and defenses *for the exact same reasons the tribes did to the tribes they decimated before them*. They were a human colony in a new foreign place, and instead of dying to them or dying on an aquatic expedition back (if they could even make the return trip), they set up camp and continued to expand like all animals. Except they just were way better equipped and more technologically advanced.

So why is the U.S. still getting so much flak and complaint hundreds and hundreds of years later? Is it simply because they were the last winners, and by definition you'll always need someone to hate and the king of the hell will get the flak? And they've now evolved into a global superpower with a sprawling economy that both is the face of capitalistic greed while lifting nations out of poverty with its economic existence, so it makes the U.S. an easy target?

And yet, the U.S. still provides support, provides special legal-sanctums (which by no means makes the crimes forgiven obviously), etc. I don't seem to see any other country, including Native Americans themselves, who hundreds of years later still spend so much effort and attention on the people they conquered HUNDREDS of years ago.

It's obviously a terse topic, but am I missing something else here? Weren't the Native Americans doing the same thing? Haven't a lot of other cultures done the same, if not more gruesome stuff? Or is it simply we will always need a finger to point and cry at, and the almighty winning U.S. is the obvious target?",2020-03-19 06:41:44,changemyview
CMV: The quality of new video games has diminished because of lack of imagination on the part of developers.,"I want to get two things out of the way immediately:

* I am talking about multiplayer games with a competitive element 
* I am talking about triple A releases that are likely to be played by a lot of people.

There are great single-player (Untitled Goose Game, e.g.) or couch co-op (Overcooked, Rayman) games in recent memory.

I don't necessarily think it's a bad thing that this is the case, but the most popular titles across genre that meet the above criteria are pushing 10 years old. 

I want to look at two examples: League of Legends, and Starcraft/Starcraft 2 that kind of illustrate my point. Both of these games were smash hits on release and to this day still have large player bases. It has now been almost as long since starcraft 2 was released as it had been since the original was released. I think with starcraft 2 as with LoL, the reason they don't want to release a new game is that the elevated system requirements would lock out new users and make for a smaller player-base and less income from microtransactions, new account purchases, etc... while simultaneously killing the old game.

This is where the lack of imagination comes in. I think developers a lot of the time only make a sequel to a game to improve the graphics. They don't want to make a new game using the same IP because they don't want to have a smaller player-base due to sys-reqs, but they can't actually think of a compelling way to expand on the old game without doing so. As such the games just sort of eventually fizzle out without their market really getting sucked up by another title in the same genre. 

This is a deathknell for certain genres that are dominated by a particular development team. I would like to have faith that there would will be a great new (e.g.) RTS game with a giant player-base, but I just don't see anything on the horizon. Do people think something else is going on?",2020-03-19 04:48:52,changemyview
CMV: Prostitution Should be Legalized Across America,"**I believe that prostitution should be legalized across the entire continental United States.** 

**#1)** If opposition to prostitution was about protecting women, then prohibition has certainly proved itself to be the very worst possible approach as sex workers live in fear of imprisonment and have to operate without any sort of legal recourse or protection whatsoever from violent pimps, traffickers, and clients who utilize the fact that it is an illegal enterprise against them. In order to protect women, we have to legalize sex work so that there is no longer any market for pimps and traffickers. Moreover, the state of Nevada proves that it is possible to have a well-regulated and legal system of prostitution.

**#2)** If opposition to prostitution was about Christian morals or beliefs, then prohibiting prostitution is unconstitutional and ought to be struck down by the Supreme Court, since America is a secular nation. Moreover, the Sexual Revolution completely obliterated any semblance of innocence or traditional values surrounding our nation's attitudes toward sex. Divorce, cheating, and sex outside of marriage are common and established staples in American society, along with pornography, homosexuality, and orgies involving more than two people, among other practices that would have been prohibited in the kind of traditional society that moralists are invoking, religious or otherwise. 

**Finally, and this is partially connected with my second point,**

**#3)** If opposition to prostitution was about there being something particularly atrocious or morally abominable about the sale of sex for money, then why does the Playboy Mansion exist? Famous male celebrities and athletes such as Hugh Hefner and Leonardo DiCaprio use their wealth, prestige, and status to sleep with the world's most beautiful women on a daily basis. Yet many of the same moralists and even otherwise progressive individuals who might oppose prostitution for one reason or another still look up to these rich male celebrities and/or view them with indifference. But for some reason, average males who utilize the services of prostitutes are viewed with utter contempt and disgust by everyone in the world except their mothers, even by the same women who fawn over these big time male celebrities who openly use their money to sleep around!

**In Conclusion,** I believe that keeping prostitution illegal is a form of elitism that exists for no reason other than to oppress the average male. If I were a celebrity using my wealth, prestige, and status to have sex with supermodels, then law-enforcement would not care, and society would glorify me for it. But as it is, I risk imprisonment for engaging in the same sort of behavior as a male celebrity simply because I am unfortunate enough to fall under a lower income bracket. Moreover, it is also a form of elitism against women too, since sex workers not fortunate enough to be supermodels or Instagram famous have to also risk imprisonment for providing their services to average males like me, whereas the women who sleep around with male celebrities for money are basically immune from prosecution. In essence, a woman is not allowed to be a sex worker unless she is serving the Hollywood elite.",2020-03-19 03:26:08,changemyview

"CMV: In the Ballad of Buster Scruggs, the quadruple amputee does not *spoiler*","die.

I've shopped this theory around, and I think it holds up. I haven't yet heard definitive arguments against it. Let's see if that changes.

Let's put the amputee short story aside for a moment, and look at only the other shorts. What is the only thing about them that connects them thematically, besides how they're all set in the wild west? It's death, obviously. But more importantly, it's the *sort of person* who dies that matters.

Buster Scruggs himself is the first to die. He's something of a pastiche of the old-timey western hero, complete with musical numbers. He's a totally unbeatable gunslinger, constantly showing off how good he is by doing totally unnecessary and flashy tricks to down his assailants. At the end, he gets killed because he refuses to have a count in a duel. He is so confident in his abilities, that he never once considered that he might not actually be the fastest gun in the west. One could say that it was his Pride that ultimately got him killed.

The unnamed bank robber, played by James Franco, gives little indication of his motives for robbing that bank. But it leads him down a path that eventually winds him up getting hanged, twice, with the second attempt actually being successful. The only line of his that seems to come out of left-field is the very last line before he's executed: He sees an attractive woman in the crowd, and says ""There's a pretty girl"". Given this is our only clue about him outside of what we see in the short itself, we can assume that his motive for stealing money had something to do with wanting to find a pretty girl, since back then, marriages were typically decided by a girl's parents who may not accept a proposal from a man who was poor. So what really got him hanged was his Lust.

Are you seeing a pattern yet? Good. The Prospector short is largely peaceful throughout, with the prospector gleefully toiling away at locating a vein of gold for several days. Until the end, where moments after he finally finds the pocket of gold, he is attacked by a man who presumably had been scouting him out, waiting for the time when all the dirty work had been done and he could reap the benefits of the prospector's hard work. Greed is the deadly sin being committed here, and the prospector kills the vulture, continuing the theme of the deadly sins being, well, deadly.

Next is the story of Alice, as she travels to Oregon to potentially find a husband along with her brother who has a dubious business opportunity there. She has no say in this plan, but she never even attempts to have one either. Throughout the entire short, she does nothing except go along with what other people tell her to do. Her father, her brother, and also random strangers, even if she knows the ideas are bad ones, such as her brother's business that has no chance of taking off. She even agrees to marry a man she had just met without even thinking about it first. When she and another man are attacked by a native warband, she's given a gun and told that killing herself would be preferable to what would happen if they had captured her. And the very moment it seemed like they would be captured, she does as she was told and commits suicide. If she had hesitated a few seconds longer, she'd have lived and been able to return to the caravan. But she did what she always did: exactly as she was instructed to. She never once takes agency for herself and only ever lets others guide her. The sin here, obviously, is Sloth.

So what of the amputee? The short clearly implies that Liam Neeson tosses him off a cliff and drowns, but for the Deadly Sin theme to make any sense, he'd *have* to have been guilty of one of them. The only ones left of the seven are Gluttony, Envy, and Wrath, but none are displayed by him at any point. He has to be constantly cared for, but it is though no fault of his own, so it can't be gluttony. He displays no real emotion or want outside of a constant moroseness, likely because of his situation, so wrath and envy are out as well.

But he dies, right? The short clearly implies that Liam Neeson throws him off a cliff and into a river, where he would surely drown if the fall doesn't kill him, but the thing is, we never actually see this happen. As Neeson walks up to the amputee to attempt his murder, the screen fades to black, and we see Neeson riding alone in his wagon with the chicken that he bought. This is odd, because in this story, the only person guilty of a deadly sin was Neeson's character, namely Envy, as he clearly is maddened by how he must constantly care for this helpless actor who is also his only source of income. The first chance he gets, he replaces the amputee with a chicken that can do tricks and would rather kill the amputee than have both him and the chicken as ways to make money. His only motivation is that he's sick of caring for a man who can't care for himself.

But Neeson's character doesn't die. We see him at the end of the short in his wagon, traveling to his next destination. Or do we? How could it be possible for the amputee to have somehow survived and his handler to die? I've left one of the shorts out of my summary; the final one, where we see three people traveling, as we discover, to the afterlife (each of them display one or more of the deadly sins in this sequence, btw). The important thing about this short as it relates to my theory is that the afterlife, and the road to it, is represented as being indistinguishable from the world of the living at face-value. Therefore, it is possible that when we see Liam Neeson driving his wagon through an empty icy wilderness, it actually may be his Hell, forever doomed to ride his wagon with his only company being a chicken that he would have traded another man's life for. His expression in this scene is not happy, but weary. Not the face of a man who everything has worked out well for.

So that's my theory. For the purpose of maintaining thematic cohesion, the most likely outcome of the amputee's story is that he fought off his handler and the handler died there instead.",2020-03-19 02:45:08,changemyview
CMV: There is not a rationally consistent abortion rights argument,"The way I see it, every argument for a fetus/unborn child not having a right to life prior to point X boils down to the creation of an arbitrary and moving target based on the current state of technology and medicine. This, in turn, really just says that if medicine cannot save a life, you can morally kill it. So coma patients or the terminally ill? Fair game?

The other alternative is that up to the moment of birth it's the mother's choice. Seems to boil down to a matter of geography (a foot or less in any direction and it's a life, but as long as it's in the womb, regardless of how many weeks along, and it's not?)

I don't know if I really buy that life begins at the moment of conception, but it does seem to at least present a consistent logical perspective. So at least it's got that going for it, which is nice.

And yes, I'm aware that logically consistent isn't there same as correct or incorrect. Plenty of logically consistent arguments have been totally wrong because the fundamental assumption behind the logical construct is wrong. For the sake of this argument I'm not going after the very political question of right or wrong, I'm just trying to see if there is a less structurally flawed pro-choice argument then the ones I've previously encountered.

CMV: Joe Biden should select Wisconsin Senator Tammy Baldwin as his VP running mate in 2020,"I make this assertion as a point of tactics, if Joe Biden is smart. 

Tammy Baldwin clicks a lot of boxes

1) She's a woman (it's not important to me, personally), and it would be in step with his pledge to select one as his running mate. He'd be keeping his word, on top of picking someone with experience in the Senate. Baldwin is also not too old (58).

2) She's from a swing state, and perhaps, the most crucial swing state in the 2020 elections that would really go a long way in giving Democrats back the White House. Wisconsin is also arguably the hardest state for Dems to win back (after maybe Ohio) in the Mid West this Fall, as it is more rural and white than Michigan and Pennsylvania. Trump won Wisconsin in 2016 by less than 1%. The President would have to put some serious time and energy here playing defense.

3) The Democratic National Convention is taking place this July in **Milwaukee**. I think it's a smart decision, and it would be a nice gesture to select a local native of Wisconsin to really rev up the convention and give it an extra kick. It would give it an extra meaning.

4) Baldwin is a member of the LGBT community. She'd likely have at least some appeal there, and it would be a net positive in today's America, as the country has roughly a 65% support of same sex marriage. The Evangelical community will not like it, but they are an increasingly dissipating minority. 

A VP debate between her and Pence, an Evangelical himself, would also serve as a tenuous foil that would put him in an uncomfortable position in defending his religious stance on the matter. Her identity may not be directly made an issue nor referenced in the debate...but it'll be the white elephant in the room, for better or worse. Pence may not make mention of it, but it will manifest in it's own way, and force the current VP into a defensive position. It's America. Identity politics are a thing. We know it.

5) Baldwin is a Progressive in the Senate, but not as much as someone like Bernie Sanders. She's more in the vein of an Elizabeth Warren lefty, maybe even a little to her right. Having her on the ticket would be a gesture to the more left leaning wing of the Party. Joe Biden is a centrist Democrat. Having someone not too far to his left, but still to his left, would be a tactical approach to attract some more liberal leaning voters.

6) Biden-Baldwin rolls off the tongue. It may sound silly, but we subconsciously associate nice sounding things with desirability. Politics is just as much about aesthetics and perception as it is about substance.


-------------------

Other candidates like Kamala Harris and Amy Klobuchar don't really bring anything to the ticket.

Harris has proven to be a bad campaigner. She's from the most liberal state in the country, California, a state that any Democratic nominee is pretty much guaranteed to win anyways. Her hypothesized appeal to the African American community should rightly be viewed as thoroughly debunked, as she went nowhere with them in pre-primary polling. She had to drop out before the primaries even began.

Klobuchar is from Minnesota, which is, after Illinois (because of Chicago) the most liberal state in the Mid West. Clinton won MN in 2016, as have every Democratic nominee dating back to **fucking 1952**. She also has no appeal to anyone other than Centrist, moderate Democratic voters.

Stacey Abrams' name has been floated. But she would be quite risky.

For starters, Biden doesn't really need help with the African American vote. He trampled the competition in the South Carolina primary among AA voters, and there's evidence to believe he'd be able to win back black voters that didn't turn out in high enough numbers in Detroit and Philadelphia for Hillary Clinton in 2016. For all the meme's it's produced, the ""bromance"" with President Obama is a real advantage for Biden this time around that could legitimately be the reason he defeats Donald Trump. Secondly, Abrams lacks executive experience compared to Baldwin, Harris, and Klobuchar. Selecting her would be seen as an obvious, hollow maneuver to goad a demographic that Biden is in no danger of losing in the first place.",2020-03-19 01:47:33,changemyview

First and foremost, the deterministic notion that we are born with a set of parameters that varies tremendously from your average person to the next, and that we can in no way overcome these so-called parameters, is absurd. What doctors will tell us is that we have natural chemical imbalances that cannot be overcome, and this simply is not true. Of course there are those who indisputably have physical and mental deficiencies, but I do not believe that personality disorders fit into this category.

Now, concerning ADHD specifically:

I truly believe that every symptom associated with ADHD, some of which are: inability to focus, disorganization, irritability, trouble coping with stress, impulsivity, and problems following through with plans, are all personality deficiencies where a person is the weakest. Maybe it was the way you were raised, or some other set of circumstances that led to your being this way, but either way, these are areas in which an individual CAN mature.

The problem is that \*I believe\*(I'm astrisizing this to emphasize that there is no consensus on this among scientists) that the neurotransmitting systems in the brain are feedback systems, and if their feedback is negative (or low), this can create a cyclical pattern of bad habits leading to low levels of neurotransmitters which makes the individual depressed, resulting in a low level of motivation, focus, general euphoria and confidence, which weigh the individual down.

As has been know for millennia among certain groups, thoughts become actions, actions form our habits, and our habits mold our character. If you want to change the person you are, if you want to improve, change your habits, this may mean a small adjustment for you, or perhaps a complete change in lifestyle. Keep in mind that your thought patterns are too habits, and those can be the hardest to change for some people, so learn to be mindful of your thoughts.",2020-03-19 01:07:56,changemyview
CMV: Pirating video games as a teen is ethical.,"EDIT : Since I can't change the title, I'll put it here : I'm switching the word 'ethical' to 'Not morally wrong'. Sorry for the mistake, my first time on this platform. 

I'm underaged and can't get a source of income. I have strict parents. And I just happened to have a hobby of gaming, but how can I game without money?

A - every 'job' for a teen is not efficient and it can take months to save up just a scrap of 100-200$

B - online stuff like taking surveys, selling timelapses, editing videos, and investing in the stock market require a credit card account and my dad obviously won't allow me that

C - Can't ask my parents to buy me the game because I can only buy like 1 game every 6 months and if it's expensive or above 70-85 dollars they most probably wont let me. Good games come out frequently.

As far as the companies are concerned, I won't be willing to buy the game in the first place because I'm broke. I don't exist for them, not in the game's sales or their loss. So downloading a copy of a game every now and then is pretty much like accepting a free car.

Pirating the game counts as 'not buying it', right? So I'm literally not buying it. It's an irrelevant and out of bounds copy of the game.   When I do get my own job, I'll stop pirating and make up for it by buying every game I pirated on steam. And to be honest the Witcher 3 was just awesome and I'm willing to buy two full copies of the game to support the developers. I also feel really bad for pirating an indie like Celeste but I also will be getting the steam version for that.  Without piracy I wouldn't even have played those games in the first place, causing a lost sale to the developers.  Piracy is not immoral to the ones who use it fairly. As to the people who have a job and can afford games but still pirate because 'its free games', those are the ones you should be concerned about. You can't change their mind and they aren't willing to pay for games but I sure as hell am willing when I get a job.",2020-03-19 00:42:10,changemyview

But I live in a red state, where my (blue) vote doesn't matter. Is there any reason for me to vote, then, other than a symbolic drop in the bucket for the Democrats?  Sure, Biden will get one more vote for the popular, but that ultimately doesn't matter.

CMV: Forced diversity has gone too far,"Now I know what you might be thinking. I'm just some privileged white guy from the suburbs. I'm not, actually. I'm Asian and grew up in an immigrant family who came to the country with little to no assets.

I find forced diversity a form of racism in a way to where people are discriminating against certain minority groups, and even white Americans and we're really just teaching young people the wrong type of lesson that racism is okay only when done to certain groups of people.

I see some job listings that only women and minority ethnic groups can apply, and even preferring to hire certain groups of minorities leaves out other groups of minorities who might be equally qualified for the position. [https://www.inc.com/suzanne-lucas/job-posting-candidates-must-be-african-american-native-american-hispanic/latino-am.html](https://www.inc.com/suzanne-lucas/job-posting-candidates-must-be-african-american-native-american-hispanic/latino-am.html)

See Harvard discrimination against Asian college students as a blatant and legal form of discrimination in the application process but this is considered okay because it's ""diversity.""

[https://www.usnews.com/news/education-news/articles/2019-10-01/judge-upholds-harvards-race-based-admissions-policy](https://www.usnews.com/news/education-news/articles/2019-10-01/judge-upholds-harvards-race-based-admissions-policy)

I just feel like this sends entirely the wrong message that it is okay to only want certain groups of people into an organization and others not. This also translates into the workforce with affirmative action quotas.

I'm well past graduating from college but I would not want any of my kids to be paying money to an openly racist institution like Harvard University even though it's the ""top"" college in the country and it's disgusting that this type of discrimination is 100% legal.

Diversity initiatives were well intentioned but it's gotten to the point where we have now ""reverse racism,"" and racism within even certain minority categories against other minorities.

Edit: And if you don't believe me feel free to click on the links and at least read through them before commenting. I'm open to feedback and any constructive criticism of my post.

Edit2: If you want racism to end somebody has to be the bigger person and just stop playing the game entirely. Fighting discrimination with more discrimination won't end it. People just need to make ammends and move on with each other's lives.

Edit3: And if you believe minorities can't be racist you're part of the problem, too.",2020-03-19 00:21:46,changemyview
CMV: You Don't Have Free Will,"cmv: Free will doesn't exist, and the feeling of free will is an illusion. 

Definition of free will that I'm referring to: The ability to make choices that are not determined by factors outside of your control.

Just try to not read this. Language is automatic, yuor brain interprets the light form this screen itno meaning whether or not you wnat it to. And eevn wehn wrods are jubmled, you can still raed whit lttile to no effort. Same with spoken language. Ask someone to say random but real words out loud and your brain automatically will translate that into a concept you understand and are familiar with, unless you don't know the word. Sometimes your brain fails, but do you know why? No, it just happens. Now I think every process in the brain is similar to language in that it just happens, and then in retrospect you are convinced it originated from you. 

Why do you do things? There are only two answers to this. Because you want to, or because you are forced to. Why work? you want money. Why do the right thing? You want to feel good about yourself. Why scream when you are suddenly scared? Your reflexes forced you to. Think of anything you could ever do, it all boils down to being a want, or being forced. Write a comment that won't fall into one of these categories if you don't believe me, and I'll show you it's quite true.

Now I'm sure you think that as long as you want to do something, then that's free will. You are choosing what you want to do. Well, not quite. What's your favorite food? What's a food you hate? Why do you like one and not the other? If you truly do control your wants, then try wanting the food you hate. Or if you want a harsher example. . . I assume you aren't a pedophile. Whether gay, straight, bi, or pan, you likely are attracted to adults. Well try wanting children in a sexual manner. You can't do it, can you? If you're like me, this thought exercise likely just made you a bit queasy or even upset. But you still can't control why you want an adult sex partner and not a child. It's like this for every want and dislike. You hate what you hate and love what you love, you don't control why you feel the way you do.

Feelings and thoughts are chemical and electrical reactions inside of a piece of wet meat in your skull. Your brain is built with your DNA, which was made without your control. And it was further modified by your environment as you grew up, which you also didn't control. 

Even if the universe isn't determimistic, quantum randomness won't get you free will either. You don't control randomness. By definition it is unpredictable, which means you have no control over it.

CMV: Transgender people shouldn’t be allowed to transition,"(First off, not for me but for arguments against people like my family who are very strong Christians. I’ll be telling it like I’m the one who believes it though)

People who believe they are trans have other mental disorders that they need to sort out because being transgender doesn’t exist. It CAN’T exist because God “knits you together in the womb,” as it says in the Bible. Also, just because you want to do something doesn’t mean you do it! For example, just because you feel like killing someone doesn’t mean you do it. And you don’t gamble all your money away just because you want to!

You were born the gender you were born as and you can’t change that; you’re always going to have XX chromosomes or XY chromosomes and nothing you can do will change that. 

It just doesn’t make sense that you can choose your gender. Like you can’t just go up to someone and say “I’m a doctor because that’s what I feel like” without going to medical school. It’s the same for gender! You can’t just say “I’m a boy” because you feel masculine or “I’m a girl” because you feel more feminine; it doesn’t work like that.",2020-03-19 00:05:07,changemyview

CMV: Language is defined by how it is used.,"Basically, I think that there is no ""correct"" use of language. i.e. grammar, spelling, pronunciation, meaning, etc. Language is every evolving and changes with the times and by the people who use it. There are obviously incorrect ways, (I can't make the argument that TOAST is spelled with seven Qs and defines the direction birds fly on Tuesdays.) that is just nonsense. I often hear people correcting pronunciation, but there is no real correct way to say things. Accents and dialects are clear examples of that. Even the meanings of words change. Words get used as slang and eventually take on new meanings. For example, boner used to mean a blunder or mistake.

The point of language is to convey information. As long as all parties can understand the intention of the used language, then the information was conveyed and the point of language was met.

CMV: We should let cruise lines die instead of bailing them out,"Cruise ships have been one of the hardest hit areas by this virus, and there's been talk of bailouts. Donald Trump was recently asked about it in a press conference and he expressed that it might happen. I'm not so sure if other countries are considering bailouts but I know across the globe the cruise industry is in trouble right now.

Almost every other industry that could be bailed out, I see a reason. Tons of industries depend on airlines. Lots of jobs require tons of travel, it fuels the tourism industries, it allows people to travel. If the airlines go under and a good replacement doesn't come up, that would have lots of negative effects all around. There's an argument for banks and major markets too, because tons of normal people tend to lose a ton of savings if they go under.

But Cruise Lines don't serve any necessary purpose besides entertainment. [They put out tons of pollution](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesellsmoor/2019/04/26/cruise-ship-pollution-is-causing-serious-health-and-environmental-problems/#571bbbf237db), they [have tons of ethical issues with how they treat employees and various other ethical issues](https://www.tourismconcern.org.uk/floating-abominations-exposing-the-cruise-ship-industry/), and they aren't a necessary form of travel.

The only potential innocent casualty I see is some of the island towns that are frequented by cruises, but even then the environmental impact on them can be very bad, and a lot of those towns are based in other countries than where the cruise line takes off from, so that money is leaving the original host country anyway.

[Here's a really good video from Hasan Minhaj's Netflix show talking about all the environmental, ethical, and legal issues with cruises](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nCT8h8gO1g). They exploit workers, skimp on safety, and sweep crime under the rug.

I'd be interested in hearing a good argument as to why we should bail out the cruise industry, and why it's even worth having in the first place, short of just people enjoy cruises.",2020-03-18 23:35:50,changemyview
CMV: I am Anti-Zionist,"At present I define myself as anti-Zionist; that is, I disagree with the principle of Zionism. As I understand it and for the purposes of this CMV, Zionism essentially means the following: the intentional mantainance of a ""Jewish"" state, meaning that any Jewish person around the world has the right to travel and live there, and that a Jewish majority population is intentionally mantained. To clarify, I am discussing the principle of Zionism as I defined above, not the current state of the Israel/Palestine conflict or anything similar. 

I can be convinced to change my view if I am convinced of any of the following:

*  that anti-Zionism is indeed anti-Semitism, as I am against all forms of racial and religious discrimination. Duh. 
* that Zionism is not a fundamentally discriminatory ideology.

I recognise that this is a heated and contreversial topic, so let's keep it civil please.

The reason I oppose Zionism in the abstract is that, in my eyes, it's morally wrong for a state to take any action with the goal of mantaining any kind of racial or religious majority. I also think it's wrong for any state to give the exclusive rights for members of a particular ethnic or religious group to travel to and/or live in said state. The common analogy that I make is with Christianity - if a state were to proudly and intentionally mantain a Christian majority, and give the right for any Christian anywhere in the world to travel there, I'd see that the same way I see Zionism - discriminatory and wrong. The common response is that the Jewish people are an ethno-religious group rather than simply a religious group; however, I don't think that's relevant. To me, that seems to be shifting from religious discrimination to racial discrimination, which I have to still oppose. 

So there you have it. I am anti-Zionist. CMV!",2020-03-18 23:25:55,changemyview
CMV: People are sheep and will believe/go along with whatever the mainstream opinion is. The entertainment industry provides the best example of this phenomenon.,"I feel like most people are drones and will just believe and go along with whatever the “mainstream” opinion is no matter what the context is. Especially if the opinion is held by someone of influence. I’m about to collect a lot of downvotes, but when Call of Duty Infinite Warfare came out years ago, it felt like the world hated it and everyone talked about how bad it was. There was an attack by the Youtubers against that game. Nowadays I see more people saying how they wish they gave it a chance now that more Youtubers have made videos saying that it’s good. 


Batman V Superman was pretty much universally hated and attacked by critics; as a result people hated it and the box office dropoff was steep, and nowadays I see people saying that “DC should stay dark”. But when they did that, people cried and whined. Now there’s people saying that it wasn’t so bad. Funny how I was attacked mercilessly years ago for saying it was good, but now it’s “okay” to think it’s good. Nowadays the mainstream audience prefers Marvel and I see nothing but hate for DC related live action films. You get made fun of for saying you prefer DC. 


A few years ago the Xbox 360 was the more popular system of choice and everyone I knew had one. I never really saw hate for Microsoft. Nowadays it’s the opposite. I see many saying how Xbox is a failed brand and how the Xbox One sucks and how PlayStation has always been the superior brand. Anyone saying that they prefer Xbox gets attacked and told how their platform has “no games”.  I don’t even remember when this narrative started. 


Say what you want about Donald Trump, but I’ve seen a lot of misinformation in the form of quotes that he never said or things that he never did get reposted and quoted by his opponents; especially during the previous election. There is a specific false quote that I saw reposted countless times and many rallied behind this misinformation. This is not a political post and I won’t acknowledge any reply trying to argue with me about this.

"CMV: Labels and Over-Simplistic Generalizations are making honest, nuanced debate almost impossible.","Progressive. Conservative. Libtard. Right-Wing Nut-Job. Trumpette. Bernie Bro. Socialist. Capitalist. Libertarian. Communist. Fascist. Christian. Atheist. Millennial. Boomer. Brown. Black. Rich. Poor. 

Labels can be useful. They help us identify commonality, to place things into categories for big-picture analysis. However, none of the Labels listed above gives you a full picture. Describing someone/thing with a singular term is wholly insufficient. It completely erases the nuance, the complex interplay that makes up every individual (who they are, their values, their behavior) and their experiences. No person is just “Black” or just “Christian.” No idea is just “Socialist.” They are a million complicated, overlapping, sometimes contradicting things all rolled into one. And acknowledging this nuance is how we truly see and understand them. 

We see this over-simplistic reduction happening all the time: The “Libs” being blamed for this, “millennials” blamed for that, Trump Supporters are all “racist,” Universal Healthcare is “socialist” and will lead to “socialism”. All of these grand, sweeping statements about large groups of people or complex ideas are not only unhelpful, they’re harmful, as they obfuscate the truth and make actual discussion almost impossible. 

One of the most insidious element to Labeling, as it is with stereotypes, is that they’re often based on SOME kind of truth. The cheap Jew, the Asian who excels at math, the loud Black lady in the movie theater: all of these people exist! You’ve probably met one, I know I have (I’m Jewish and used to hound some of my Jewish friends for being so cheap and reinforcing the stereotype). The PROBLEM comes when we only see in absolutes, and extrapolate one piece of truth to IMPLY other truths without any evidence. 

“Bernie Bro’s” and “Trump Supporters” are, similarly, unfairly maligned as one-dimensional caricatures, devoid of any nuance or complexity. Yes, there are aggressive, misogynistic Bernie Sanders supporters out there, and yes there are plenty of Trump Supporters who are aggressively racist and will believe everything he and Fox News says. 

But those few individuals DO NOT define everyone who supports either of these candidates, nor does “Misogynist” or “Racist” accurately describe the entirety of those specific individuals. There are tons of “racists” out there who support a woman’s right to choose. There are plenty of “misogynists” who declare Black Lives Matter. There are “conservatives” who support Marriage equality. There are “progressives” who like Capitalism. People don’t fit into neat little categories. 

The same applies to values, ideas and policies. Universal Healthcare is, most definitely, a “Socialist” idea. But what does that matter? How does Labeling a policy “Socialist” actually move the discussion forward in terms of its cost/benefit analysis and whether or not it’s good for our country? Our K-12 education is technically “socialist.” So is our military. So is our police/fire departments. So are the government subsidies that some of our major industries receive. Calling them “socialist” doesn’t even begin to address their purpose or their effectiveness. Instead of debating which policies would be most beneficial for the most people, we’re arguing over whether or not it’s “Socialism.”

Finally, don’t forget about “narrative.” People in high positions of power have the ability to dictate national discussions by “controlling the narrative”—feeding a consistent message to the media and the public, designed to keep the discussion on their terms: simplistic, black &amp; white, complete with talking points for each side to parrot. Certain things in life we would probably be arguing about anyway, but some things are fed to us specifically because they’re controversial and split us into opposing sides. Once we’re on “our” side, everything fits much more easily into our narrative-filled, confirmation-bias-driven egos, and the Labeling begins. 

Labels can be extremely helpful, but they are only one of many tools we must use to understand our world. And right now it feels like they too often used as a crutch, an over-simplified substitute for real, nuanced understanding, leaving Americans to spend their time trying “win” arguments for their “side”, instead of focusing on our myriad similarities and shared beliefs to find practical solutions to our common problems.",2020-03-18 21:17:24,changemyview
"CMV - The Millennial generation (and maybe even those who come after) will spend the rest of their lives digging out of a hole, and therefore should lower their expectations for what to expect out of life.","Figuratively speaking, at least - whether it be the current crisis and its likely long-reaching ripple effects, global warming, a $22 trillion (and rapidly growing) national debt, the projected shortfall of the Social Security fund, the student loan crisis, or just the general fact that we make less from work and pay more for necessities than previous generations. We will never be without a society-wife crisis to try and work our way out from under. 

Each on their own these are all crises that, if left unaddressed, could negatively alter all of society dramatically. All of them have been and will continue to weigh us down until addressed. Solving one of these issues would be a monumental achievement in its own, solving all of them in the span of a generation is impossible. We will live the rest of our lives under the shadow of these issues. 

In the short term the economy is about to take a massive step back, we’ll have to deal with all that entails. Our climate is changing, more sacrifices will need to be made to fix that. National debt will require more taxes and fewer beneficial programs that might otherwise improve our lives. We’re under the thumb of creditors and have been since we graduated college, that has and will continue to put our own individual “American Dreams” on hold. At the end of all of that, retirement will be only what you’re able to finance for yourself. And we need to do all this with less disposable income than any generation that preceded us. 

The best we can ever hope is to make SOME progress on each of these issues, and leave our kids and grandkids a world where there is positive momentum going towards solutions for each of these. We will never be without these crises, and our lives are destined to always be held back by them. Our legacy will not be that we solved these problems, but stopped them from growing as issues and started things on the path towards solutions for future generations.

CMV: Sending food and medicine to starving people in Africa is a bad thing,"Despite the fact that I live in the United States where I have plenty to eat and a safe place to live, I still choose to not have children because I don't think it would be very responsible of me to bring a child into this world right now.  Having children is a huge responsibility.

Why then, do impoverished starving people who live in Somalia, Sudan, or Ethiopia continue to have children when they know their children will grow up in suffering and misery and likely die a premature death?  Do the adults in those countries not care about the suffering of their future children?   Women have few if any rights in Africa and rape is more prevalent on that continent than any other so women don't have much say in whether they have children or not.  This leaves the men.   Apparently, African men don't care if their children are surrounded by disease, poverty, starvation, and death.   If they did care, they wouldn't continuously have children in such an environment.  I certainly wouldn't.

We've all seen those commercials of emaciated starving children in Africa, sadly looking at the camera with flies buzzing about, and a narrator's voice appealing to the viewer: ""Won't you please sponsor this child?  For just 75 cents a day, you can provide food, clothing, shelter, medical care, and schooling for this little boy.""

What the voice doesn't tell you is that if you help that child survive, he will reach reproductive age and instead of having one million starving children today, there will be five million starving children twenty years from now.  **In other words, sending money will result in more starving, suffering, dying children.**

Death by starvation is nature's way of saying ""There are too many of you so some of you need to die.""  Children dying of hunger and disease in Africa has been going on for centuries if not millennia. I remember those commercials thirty years ago and they're still on TV today.  Nothing has changed it seems, except now there are more hungry mouths to feed as a result of such commercials.

That is not to say I am apathetic or indifferent to starving, dying children.  I am not.  It's absolutely horrible.  However, the simple fact of the matter is that by sending them money now you will create more misery, death, and suffering later.  And that's assuming your money will even get there which it probably won't.  Your money will instead be used to pay for ""administrative costs"" of running the non-profit charity organization you're donating to.  Costs such as paying the charity's staff, building expenses, advertising costs, and the generous salaries of its top officers and their chauffers.  Any left-over money will be used to send food to Africa.  These food shipments will probably be intercepted by guerrillas and warlords and sold.  The money will be used to buy weapons, food, prostitutes, and other supplies for the soldiers.  Hardly anything at all will reach the starving kids.

But even if there were no corruption and 100% of your money were used to purchase food and medical supplies for those starving villagers, it would still be a bad idea because twenty years later, you'll have five times the problem.   All those kids, instead of dying like they normally would without international aid, will survive and reproduce and only multiply the original problem.

If you really want to help starving kids in Africa, you have to do this:

-Find a way to make sure your money is not embezzled or stolen by middlemen.  Ensure your money is used to purchase food and somehow ensure this food actually reaches the starving people. This is a very difficult and important first step.

-Re-educate the entire starving population and teach them that the use of contraceptives, contrary to their religious beliefs, is perfectly okay and moral and good.  How you'll get millions of people to abandon their religious principles is a mystery.  Good luck with that one.

-Teach the local people how to survive on their own.  Give them the tools and the means.  This will be a large investment of resources at first (like drilling equipment for wells and filtration for fresh water, house construction tools, bulldozers, farming &amp; medical equipment, etc.) but it will be a one-shot deal. You won't have to return every year with more food and more supplies.  Teach them to farm and raise animals and give them the means.  If they live in a desert or some other infertile place, move them to a land which can support farming.   Any food hand-outs they receive should be temporary. They should be told as follows ""Either you learn to farm and make food for yourselves, or you will die when this aid is cut off.  It will be cut off soon.  The sooner you learn to be self-sufficient, the greater your chances of survival.""

So to sum up:

-To stop starvation, they need to grow their own food.

-To grow their own food, they have to invest their labor in the land, and expect a return on their investment.

-To expect a return on their investment, they need the assurance that what they produce will not be stolen from them at gunpoint by armed roaming hordes and militias. Currently, anyone with a gun can rob whoever doesn't have a gun.  Police are either non-existent, useless, or so corrupt that they participate in the extortion rackets.  ""Might makes right"" is the law of the land. People have no incentive to invest their money and energy into anything when they know that as soon as they create something of value, it will be taken away by force.  In short, they need property rights and those rights should be enforced.

-To enforce property rights, they need honest courts, politicians, and cops. Getting rid of the entrenched corruption is the biggest obstacle, in my opinion.  In most African nations, the leaders are corrupt.  They live in luxury while the locals starve and die.  The leaders care nothing for their own people and this is not surprising, since the more brutal and violent you are, the quicker you rise to the top.  Generally, the people at the top are sociopathic, barbaric monsters who are good are pretending to be civilized, respectable gentlemen to the Western media.  They will steal whatever money or material aid is sent to their starving population.

But getting back to the topic: Even without corruption, simply sending food and medicine *multiplies* the continued suffering of generations of people.",2020-03-18 20:26:53,changemyview

The real ideological differences between the DNC and GOP have been diminishing for years and will continue to do so until there is a paradigm shift in the values espoused by the DNC. Failure to do so will result in the continuing disenfranchisement of American citizens and make it increasingly difficult to reestablish a system of government more concerned with the needs of society than those of powerful corporations.  

Many of the most important political decisions being made, such as the patriot act and corporate bailouts, are ones that are never voted on. The American public has no say in these decisions and many of them are made as amendments and riders that the public, by and large, have no knowledge of. The representatives making these decisions are influenced in large part by corporate lobbyist (who often participate in writing the legislation intended to regulate them) and political donors.

Just because he's tooting his own horn about the few market gains during this crisis doesn't mean it's actually because of him. When the market tanks (like it has today), it doesn't mean it's his fault either despite declining responsibility.

I see the irony in this. It's highly hypocritical for him to behave like this but if we were to be truly objective, neither ups or downs are because of him. It's because of a rogue, half-alive, half-inert ""organism"" that acts without reason.

CMV: Pro-life people who believe in exceptions for rape just want to punish women and aren’t pro-life,"I feel like the stance “I support banning abortions except in cases of rape or incest” is for whatever reason treated like a rational, middle ground view

But I believe it’s actually the most problematic stance a person can take

If you want there to be zero abortions ever because you think it’s murder, I can understand that

But to say “you should only be allowed to get an abortion in cases of rape or incest” is just saying you want to punish women for having consensual sex

For example, if you *actually* believe that a baby is dying in abortion, why would you allow any exceptions at all?

The only answer I can think of is, “because rape isn’t the mother’s fault.” Which means that the pregnancy is being used as a punishment when it *is* the woman’s fault.

Additionally, it reveals that the belief-holder doesn’t believe that the consequences of an abortion are big enough to cancel out an innocent woman’s right to choose. So they can’t be pro-life.

Of course some people will try to get exceptions to abortion bans because “something is better than nothing.” But I’m talking specifically about people who hold this belief in general.

Am I missing some other way to justify this stance that isn’t awful? I feel like I must be, and I really would appreciate learning how that might be, since it seems to be fairly common

CMV: Depression is in your control (In most cases),"Before getting into this, I think I have experienced what bipolar depression is, since it has to be 2 years or something like that to be considered the actual disorder, but I was suicidal and depressed for around a year, so I don't think I am talking from ignorance.

The reason I have this view is because I know the brain is very powerful. You can create physical reactions with just willpower. I have done this a lot with my own brain, I can simulate caffeine, I can make myself happy, I can force myself to sleep. The brain is way more powerful than people give it credit for. There are studies that show you can build some muscle by just thinking of working out.

I do believe depression is caused by a chemical imbalance, but I think your brain creates that. You having depressive habits creates the imbalance which makes it harder to be happy. How I got out of my depression was learning to catch myself and stopping thoughts that would lead me down a dark path. Verbally slapping myself I guess.

Pretty much to sum up what I am trying to say ""Just be happy"" is correct. You can be happy in whatever situation you're in. Some cases are a hell of a lot harder to be happy, but the moment you think it's impossible is when it becomes impossible. If this isn't working for you it's probably because you're thinking it's out of your control. All you have to do is actually believe your will is stronger than whatever sadness, anger, and anxiety is coming over you. It's okay to stumble, progress has bumps, but never give up.

This post just goes for the majority of people. I know mental disorders actually exist that are pretty out of control, at least that's what I assume since I haven't experienced them. But from what I hear from a lot of people and my own experience, the average depression is in your control, you created it and you can get out of it.",2020-03-18 17:18:07,changemyview
CMV Detention should be abolished.,"Detention is really stupid. We have lots of things we need to do and making a child sit and ‘think about what the have done ‘ is cruel. 

I’ve noticed the children who do the ‘really naughty things’ don’t care at all if they get detention but for the children who are late one time they will be really put down.

There are other ways of punishment overall the school system is flawed and putting pressure on a child is really bad. But we don’t at all reward good behaviour. It has been proven time and time again that it’s better to work towards something then have something eating at your toes. ( sorry that was a bad metaphor) In my school we have ‘PPC’ teachers almost never give them out and overall they a pretty worthless..

Children have lots of things to do in a small amount of time after school ( homework, eat, job, family etc ) and detention takes away time for useless activities like writing lines. This is really cruel time as a child is limited and soon enough you will be going to college why would you want to be wasting it? 

Instead of detention clumping all types of stuff together we can Provide Logical Consequences.

CMV: Pitbulls are not inherently dangerous and should not be banned,"This idea was sparked for me after seeing posts from fellow redditors, so I feel like this is the best place to post even if it is less discussed now. 

Though the individual statistic varies by source, pitbulls do have seem to have the highest tendency to be dangerous making up the most likely breed to bite you. Tons of news stories including them have that narrative. I don't disagree here completely even though I think the statistic does have some issues with misrepresenting info, I won't be arguing this point because the statistics vary too much. So for this argument we will assume they have the highest tendency and that is it. 

My arguments is even if a pitbull is more likely to bite you, that doesn't come from the inherent nature of the breed but instead multiple outside factors. They were bred for fighting, but that argument just doesn't hold up when you consider how many dogs were bred for fighting. Should we ban the Akita because they were bred for fighting too? How about Dobermans, mastiffs, Rottweilers and bull terriers? If you think so then we can have a discussion on that, but I'm going to assume no. 

The pitbull's physical capabilities are not any more dangerous than other breeds. https://petcomments.com/ten-dogs-which-have-the-strongest-bite/#what-dog-has-the-strongest-bite As you can see the pitbull has a weaker bite strength than many dogs, some not even bred for fighting. They aren't bigger or stronger than other dogs either. That is my rationale on why the breed isn't mentally or physically any more dangerous than non banned dog breeds, but that isn't the entire argument which brings me back to the statistic that scares many people. 

Should they still be banned? After all the dog bite statistic is there, even if they aren't inherently dangerous and there is still an argument that the pros outweigh the cons. Even if friendly dogs and owners who love their dogs are harmed, there is an argument that the pros of saving the people harmed by dog attacks is still worth it. This one doesn't hold up either. Enacting breed specific legislature, or banning pitbulls and other dogs, has no effect on the number of dog [attacks](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/canine-corner/201902/do-breed-specific-laws-reduce-the-number-dog-bites%3famp) (Though you should, if you don't feel like reading the whole thing you can scroll down to the graph to see evidence for my point). In fact there is even an argument that breed bans distract law enforcement from preventatives that [work](https://www.aspcapro.org/resource/disaster-cruelty-animal-cruelty-animal-fighting/are-breed-specific-laws-effective#:~:text=There%20is%20no%20evidence%20that,for%20people%20or%20companion%20animals.&amp;text=Following%20a%20thorough%20study%20of,decided%20not%20to%20support%20BSL.): ""When limited animal control resources are used to regulate or ban a certain breed of dog, without regard to behavior, the focus is shifted away from routine, effective enforcement of laws that have the best chance of making our communities safer:"" 

Therefore, breed bans are ineffective and harm dogs and owners. There is even an argument that it increases dog attacks, but I won't say that for certain because I haven't found a ton of statistics to back it up. I think the reason why pitbulls are the most likely to attack is due to their reputation as well as higher population. However, I am not certain on this one, but I'm still willing to debate if this is a part of your argument. Thanks for reading.",2020-03-18 16:48:04,changemyview

CMV: Special Schools Does More Harm to High-Functioning Students than Good,"**This view means a lot to me as a former Special Education student of 12-13 years. Attending special education primary school from the age of 5 to age 12 and special education secondary school from age 12 to age 18, I noticed how flawed Special Education Schools are. of course I only started noticing it since I was 16, around the same time I started developing self-awareness shortly after I befriended a guy with Asperger's.**

From what I experienced as a student, The majority of teachers didn't really go deep into the chosen subject and didn't really experiment with their students, which explains why I sometimes notice anti-risk tendencies from my school, I remember they wrote in my school plans that I need to take risks, looking back I see it as disingenuous. also forgot to mention the overprotection is present to high-functioning students, WTF?!

I was quite disappointed that some of my classes are quite basic, my maths class being one of them, it's always basic maths, that's it! but then there was this new teacher only for one occasion, he decides to teach us how to measure buildings without a measuring type (hopefully I didn't misremembered it), the class was actually pretty interesting, we even went outside and he taught  us to use our foot to measure, too bad my motivation to learn was non-existent (blame the system for that) That guy knows how to teach a special needs class full of high-functioning students. Make a boring subject interesting and make the lesson less basic, less childish and more relevant! 

Another issue that needs to be noticed is the anti-intellectualism occurring in classes, going back to the first point I made in the second paragraph, I feel like the majority of teachers are using the condition of their students to justify why he/she doesn't go deep, for low-functioning students, it's okay because unlike high-functioning students, low-functioning students have no potentials, and they have to rely on carers (do I need to say more?) take it from a guy who was once low-functioning, 

As for high-functioning students however I believe it's anti-intellectualist and even ableist to use conditions like ASD as a justification to sacrifice the potentials of high-functioning students, I'll also argue that it's also harmful to the student's future and also mental health as well, actually, let me tell you what happened after I graduated and tried to apply to my local further-education college to learn computing,

**I got rejected! they said majority of my grades are very low, (never mind that I have IT certificates) now I need to point out that it wasn't my fault, my school has it's standards (all of the things I mentioned), how can I control that. I felt like shit after I got rejected, I lost my confidence, my self-esteem is destroyed and self-learning became more difficult.**

This is how harmful the broken system is and we need to do something about it, I have a solution!

We should move all of high-functioning students to mainstream schools and form a new system where students are focused individually by one teacher in a quiet room (A second teacher and therapists are optional) learning-style experiments should be mandatory on every wednesday and friday to see what's the most effective learning-style for the student, or at-least the closest suitable one, also afternoon social skills lessons on fridays as well. (I'm debating whether or not inclusion should be optional or mandatory). They will be treated like adults and will be taken seriously unlike special schools.

I'm very disappointed and upset that the UK government does not recognize the biggest issues of special schools and instead just pretend that special schools are flawless. 

WE SHOULD GIVE HIGH-FUNCTIONING STUDENTS THE RESPECT THEY NEED! 

Reason for this CMV is because most of my views falls under anecdotal fallacy and while it doesn't necessarily make my view invalid, I thought I might have someone convince me with facts and logic, seriously I don't consider myself intelligent, nor a expert of special education, I only have my experience and what I experienced need to be heard.

Disclaimer: This also applies to anyone else assuming stuff like that, for example Westerners (like my countrymen sometimes probably) assuming everyone else on the Internet is also a Westerner, or people from an English-speaking country assuming everyone else is from an English-speaking country. However, to be frank, I've overwhelmingly experienced this behaviour from US-Americans. I love y'all and every nation has it's shortcomings, sorry if I offended anyone.  


Now, onto my view.   
I can deal with the overwhelming presence of America-centrism in posts. American politics, ""what are you eating this Thanksgiving"", ""what was your GPA in high school"", whatever. Like those are just not for me to answer and people have every right to post it.   


However, the assumption that an OP of something is American can just be really irritating sometimes. I've seen people being called liars just because they say they've experienced something that isn't true to American society. People with names that are punny in English being bullied for them, and assuming it's something fake they made up (in Facebook meme/question groups, I kind of use Facebook like Reddit with private groups functioning a bit like subreddits). [Shit like this](https://i.redd.it/syoqaks0l9yy.jpg). People automatically assuming the OP is American in an advice/recommendation thread can make the whole thread really pointless.   


I get it, it's a small thing, but I still think it would be nice if this norm was done away with.  


**Arguments I've heard that has had a tough time convincing me:**   
\- ""They're speaking English, chances are they're American""   
There are literally more non-native English speakers than native.  
\- ""They're on a US-based website, they would use their own websites, would I go to a French website and be angry that people assumed I'm French?""  
For most countries and languages in the world, making an alternative to Reddit and Facebook and Instagram etc. catered only to their country and/or language is just not financially feasible, and it just doesn't exist. I know really big countries like Russia and China does (although some of that is also due to government censorship), but the vast majority do not. So we're pretty much forced to use American giants.   


\- ""The vast majority of the users on these platforms are Americans, it's not an unfair assumption"" straight up not true. Reddit comes the closest to that but it's still only 50% American.   


\- ""Grow a pair, there's worse things in the world, why do you care so much""

CMV: All Free to Play games with micro-transactions should have the ESRB M Rating.,"To condense my argument for this position, here are some highlights of what supports such an argument:

- Children this decade have the most access to technologies that were completely inaccessible to similarly aged children last decade.

- Free to Play games use Skinner-box psychological exploits to garner money from people who have an addictive personality (e.g., Whales) and children via. the means of pester power (which is outlawed in countries under the EU).

- A lot of mobile Free to Play games use cartoon series to appeal to children, which fall in line with the previous reason and exploiting pester power to gain money from parents.

- Most YouTubers with younger audiences are beginning to be sponsored by mobile Free to Play companies.

- The M Rating would deter parents from allowing their child to even play the game, thus giving the strategy of using micro-transactions a very negative stigma in regards to making a profit.

So summing everything up above, the M Rating would be due to the risk of having children develop an addicting personality (e.g., the reason why casinos only allow people 21 years and older to gamble) and would benefit both them and even many others so that these companies would have a reason not to use such a strategy.

So any of you are welcome to try and change my perspective on this issue, and I certainly hope we can have a conversation about this issue. Bear in mind this isn't an argument to ban Free to Play games as a whole, but more having the ESRB crack down and rate these games properly.",2020-03-18 06:50:25,changemyview

Now, since I'm rather nationalistic anyway, I don't really see that as a bad thing. We should only protect ourselves, our own trade ships, and the like.

The world wants this anyway. The Afghans obviously want the Taliban as their government. We should continue negotiating with them and work out trade. We should dial back our military presence in Europe, and stop sending them aid money. That lowers a lot of overhead for the military and leaves them in a hilarious position. From what I've seen online this is a good thing, according to Reddit as well as other sites.

If we wanted to, we could easily continue bloodying noses with our special forces and drones. That's the way warfare is going anyway.",2020-03-18 04:51:56,changemyview

CMV: The US government should create a self funded Emergency Savings Account (ESA),"In light of current events and the eventual hit to the economy, every citizen could deposit into an ESA  an arbitrary amount (like $10,000,  but the same dollar amount for everyone).  The government would pay a  premium interest rate to depositors, and the interest would be  distributed annually, but tax free.  This is not a retirement account so  no compounding of interest.

Similar to a 401k or IRA, depositors could only withdraw under a narrow set of  conditions:  national or regionally declared state of emergency, natural  disaster, etc (these obviously up for debate).

This would minimize the impact of macro events such as the one we are experiencing now.  The premium interest paid by the government may be cheaper than the costs of helping those during emergencies.

Obviously  the most vulnerable would be the least likely to fund this account, but  perhaps if it became such a ""thing"" that funding mechanisms would  develop:  an employer may offer to contribute to anyone without a fully  funded account; recent graduates have funds deposited into their account, any deposits would be pre-tax.",2020-03-18 01:28:34,changemyview
CMV: Car (all) insurance is a scam,"At first I thought about targeting car insurance and electronics insurance, but then I realized that all insurance is terrible. I certainly believe my opinion is flawed, in the end, people can waste their money on whatever they like, and car insurance is something I'm forced to pay so I might as well change my view so I don't feel ripped off and butt-hurt constantly.

1. High Administrative Costs: This is better or worse depending on the type of insurance. Some insurance brokers are paid up to 30% commission. A lot of insurance workers are unionized which means they have to be paid high wages and can not be easily fired.

2. Lack of Transparency: The exact formula insurance companies use to calculate your premium is almost never public. This makes comparison shopping extremely frustrating. Also, some companies require credit checks for quotes which could lower your credit score.

3. The Poor Pay More: In many places in the world, driving is a necessity, not a luxury. It's not uncommon for poor people who tend to have bad credit histories, short driving experience, and old/unsafe cars to pay two or three times the amount rich people pay. It might make sense if poor people got into accidents three times as likely, but there's no proof of this.

4. It's sexist, racist, ageist, ablelist, etc...: Your premiums could depend on your gender, race, age, or disability regardless of your driving history. Insurance companies go against the core philosophy of liberal democracies.

5. Collusion with government results in cronyism: In many countries, the government forces you to buy private insurance. Since governments are not known to be frugal and insurance companies want to make money, this creates worse service and higher prices for all.

6. Your return on investment is abyssmal: The average car insurance payer has an ROI of negative infinity, whereas they have no accidents. Even for people who have been in accidents, the ROI is still negative. It makes a lot more sense to invent money into a non negative low risk area.

7. Government run insurance is not much better: In Canada, the province of British Columbia which has public car insurance actually has higher premiums than privately run provinces. Governments especially love wasting money on useless unionized administrators.

8. Shady practices: There are way too many to mention, insurance brokers are worse than used car salesmen when it comes to their dirty antics.",2020-03-18 00:20:46,changemyview
"CMV: Sexuality is disgusting,disturbing and sinister."," 

Sexuality is the most horrifying disgusting thing and the fact that it exists is stone cold proof that we are wicked,disgusting people. There are no good people that enjoy sex and it's variations.The essence of sexuality is breaking another person on every level: emotionally,mentally,spiritually,ruining their life and dominating them to dust and tears. Porn is proof that what i am saying is plain true.With time,porn becomes weirder and weirder,harsher and harsher,brasher and brasher until it reveals what truly lays behind the false pretense of sexuality,behind the reflection of what it tries to be:soul crushing pain and spiritual and moral death;ruining women and getting a strong sense of sick satisfaction from it; it is the essence of what it truly means to be a man and proof that women should stay far,far away from them unless they are masochistic clowns.With time, sexuality becomes less about sex and more about torture,degradation,humiliation;the sand starts to fade off to reveal the glass,the real facet of what sex is.

Sexual attraction is a bitter poison that corrupts you.There is no need for the american government to use mkultra knowing that sexuality,porn and it's brain rewriting exists. Sexual attraction breaks and corrupts the soul. It is pure sadism. You get pleasure from harming and ruining other people(women)/beings. This is the essence of sexuality and everyone knows it.I understand that sex may be important for procreation but it definitely shouldn't be used for anything else.Definitely not for pleasure. Getting pleasure from harming others is just plain wrong and the fact that our existence begins with sexuality is proof that we have fallen deep into the depths of sin.Our existence begins within the humiliation and degradation that sex and sexuality causes to the mother. It is extremely painful.

After pregnancy, the mother starts to break emotionally and intellectually,she starts to close her years and heart,to forget all of her passions and ambitions for the sake of her man and her worm. Pregnancy is the main reason women fall behind and men love and cherish this fact,men love that they dominate and hurt women while knowing perfectly well that we are faceless beings for them,we are interchangeable for them,they'd change us for a prettier model in a heartbeat in spite of all of our sacrifices.I think that if i won't get my opinion changed i will literally take a knife and cut my clit off(i am not joking i have been fantasizing about this for a long time)",2020-03-17 23:12:32,changemyview

"CMV: Lebron is not, and never will be, the GOAT","Lebron James will never surpass Michael Jordan as the GOAT.

Michael Jordan was drafted by the Chicago Bulls in 1984 and went on to play 15 seasons in the NBA. During his career, he won six championships WITH THE TEAM THAT DRAFTED HIM. His six championships came in the form of two three-peats. Michael Jordan was a cold blooded killer on the basketball court. This to me, is what separates him from Lebron.

Lebron James was drafted in 2003 by his hometown team, the Cleveland Cavaliers. Lebron is currently in his 17th NBA season. So far, in his career, Lebron has won three championships. His first two were with the Miami Heat, and his third was with the Cleveland Cavaliers. This is where I see a huge difference between MJ and Lebron.

Lebron left the team that drafted him, his hometown team, to go form a super team with 2 all-stars in Miami. Lebron's ego was at an all time high as ESPN aired ""The Decision"", in which Lebron announced that he was betraying his hometown team and signing with Miami. And then there was the ""[welcome party](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9BqUBYaHlM)"". Need I say anymore?

Lebron and the Miami Heat did win two championships, but once their run was coming to an end, Lebron once again packed up his bags and left to go team up with 2 other all-stars.

Lebron re-signed with Cleveland and teamed up with Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love. Lebron was able to win one championship with this team as the Golden State Warriors completely imploded. In doing so, Lebron did bring a championship to his hometown.

After the Cavs won the championship, it was clear the team was slowly falling apart. Which prompted Lebron to high-jack the team and completely blow up the roster. Kyrie was so put off that he requested a trade out of Cleveland. Lebron left the Cavaliers for the LA Lakers and Kevin Love was left to die in Cleveland.

Lebron, ONCE AGAIN, left his hometown team to go team up with Anthony Davis, and likely a third all-star in LA.

Michael Jordan stayed loyal to the team that drafted him and brought them 6 championships. He had a 6-0 finals record. 

Lebron James has betrayed his hometown team twice to form super teams so that he can win championships. However, this strategy has left Lebron with only 3 rings and a whopping 5 finals losses.

Lebron James is not the cold blooded killer that Michael Jordan was. He ring chases, started the super-team trend, and hijacks organizations. Jordan showed up and balled out. Don't get me wrong, Jordan had help, but he didn't jump from team to team chasing rings. He was loyal.

That's why, in my opinion, Lebron James will never surpass Michael Jordan as the GOAT.

CMV: Nothing in life is random. Everything is predetermined and has always been predetermined. If one action creates a certain reaction then we have all been living out certain reactions that will always happen based on the first ever action.,"Everything in life has an action and a certain reaction. I don't believe you can say something ""randomly happens"" because I think that just means we don't understand the reason WHY something is happening.

I always think of this ball rolling down a hill analogy. If a ball is rolling down a hill, it is going a certain speed and path based on the slope, surface, weight of the ball, along with numerous other elements. Now sometimes that ball might change directions based on, say, a random bump in the hill. That bump is going to send that ball in a certain trajectory. Not any random trajectory. Because everything has a certain reaction. It's not random. The bump wouldn't be considered random either because there is a very specific reason the bump was there. Bumps don't magically pop up. What we have in the world is a bunch of balls rolling on this hill and all these balls (actions) are interacting with the environment (reactions) in very specific ways.

We are all just reacting to one another and there is absolutely nothing random about it which means that our path is already predetermined.

When I tell this to people they always say ""Well I could get up and do something random right now."" And you could! But based on who you are as a person, will you get up and do something random? Or has everything up in your life till this point prepared you or underprepared you for this moment to do something random. It's not really random if you have nurtured and natured yourself to respond to this scenario in a certain way.

CMV: Progressive Democrats in the US Need to Have Some Perspective.,"&gt;inb4 butt hurt Trump supporter 

I actually really agree with Sanders about almost everything, that being said, let’s get right into it.  

It seems to me that a lot of issues that matter the most to more progressive individuals revolve around fixing/changing the numerous flawed systems that exist with the nation (e.g healthcare, energy, infrastructure, social services).  I am a big fan of this.  There are a lot issues that need to be addressed, particularly in healthcare and education, to make them more affordable and accessible.

The thing that I do not like is the wild arrogance and enormous amount of entitlement that a lot of these people who support this movement have.  Some of my favorite catch phrases I’ve heard so far are:

&gt;”Every single person should have access to healthcare, education, housing, and basic needs met”.

&gt;”No person should ever have to work more than 1 job.”

&gt;”Free Access to family planning services is a human right”.

And here’s the thing, I’m not even disagreeing with the sentiment of these statements.  The US wastes how many billions of dollars every year subsidizing corporations and fighting meaningless wars for Israel instead of investing in its own citizens.  We HAVE the capability to drastically raise quality of life for the average American but choose not to, instead dumping 700 billion per year into defense.  It’s disgusting.

What rubs me so much the wrong way is the way progressives act like the US is basically the 3rd world unless you’re a top 1%er.  Like yes, we have problems, but just be aware that billions of people around the world would literally kill to take your place.  And not only that, but the fact that modern healthcare the way we have it today  has only existed for like 50-60 years.  Life existed virtually unchanged for humans on earth for 1000s of years, and you’re lucky enough to be born in a 1st world nation that is undergoing the biggest technological leaps and bounds in all of history.  Yes, things need fixed, but get a fucking grip and realize that you live better than most people could ever dream of.

It’s good to fight for change and seek to better quality of life for the common man, but you make yourself look like a spoiled child when you don’t acknowledge how lucky you are.  Demanding world class healthcare and education at the expense of “muh billyunaries” doesn’t paint you in the best light, no matter how much they can afford to pay for it.

"CMV: The Bulbasaur line, is, without much doubt, the best starter for an ingame playthrough in the original red and blue","Reasons:

There are a few main reasons for why Bulbasaur is the best Red &amp; Blue starter. They go:

1. Best time against gyms - this is perhaps the most commonly used argument for why Bulbasaur is the best starter for an ingame playthrough. Not only does he easily beat the first 2 gyms, he resists the 3rd (which might as well count as beats), goes even with both the 4th and 5th, and really only struggles with Sabrina and Blaine (we'll get to that later). Furthermore, he comes back in the last gym against Giovanni
2. Better moves than the other starters - something people don't know is that Venusaur gains the Toxic/Leech seed glitch in generation 1, which allows for essentially exponential healing as the leech seed BECOMES the toxic damage. Furthermore, Venusaur also learns both Growth, which raises the absolutely busted special stat in gen 1 (something that neither Charizard nor Blastoise gains access to), and also gains the only sleeping move (another broken gen 1 move). This allows for Venusaur to have a very diverse movepool from either a stall tank or a special sweeper. 
3. Easier to evolve - Bulbasaur evolves to Venusaur at level 32, a good four levels before either of the other two starters, meaning you will have a Venusaur before both Charizard and Blastoise.

&amp;#x200B;

Addressing common counterarguments:

1. ""But you need a fire type AND a flyer, and Charizard fits both those roles!"" - there are multiple problems with this argument for Charizard. #1, you don't... actually need a fire type in gen 1. Fire types don't really do all that well in Kanto, period, thanks to that fact that most of the Team Rocket grunts had common pokemon like Geodude and Sandshrew (both of which are weak to grass, yet another reason why Bulbasaur is superior). At the end of the day, the only thing fire does legitimately well against in gen 1 would be Erika's gym, which you could always just get a flying type for anyway. #2, Charizard ISN'T actually a flyer in Gen 1. In actuality, Charizard actually doesn't gain ANY flying type moves in gen 1, meaning that the only thing that his flying type does is add extra weaknesses for x4 rock and an electric weakness. It also gets rid of his resistance to ice type moves. All of this in trade for 1 immunity to ground types. Also, Arcanine,  is just a better fire type for Kanto anyway ;)
2. ""But squirtle is the most common among speedrunners!""- yes, this is true. And it also proves nothing. Faster =/= better by any means. Bulbasaur isn't meant to be a one shot or fast killer anyway. The fact is, he still gives the easiest time in Kanto, and Squirtle is still weaker to more early gyms (Lt. Surge and Erika) in which you would not have developed a full team by that time yet. 
3. ""But Venusaur has the weakest stab move of Razor Leaf compared to Flamethrower and Hydro Pump!"" - people forget the crit mechanics of the first generation. Fun fact, Razor Leaf ALWAYS crits on Venusaur, no matter what. What this means is that Razor Leaf has a 110 base power instead of 55 like it's supposed to have, which is actually MORE than Flamethrower, and 10 less than Hydro pump (despite it having 5x more PP). Furthermore, since Razor Leaf is always a critical hit, it ignores stat changes, unlike that of Flamethrower and Hydro Pump. In actuality, Razor Leaf is the BEST of the stab move each starter gets. Plus, even if it wasn't, again, Venusaur is the only one of the 3 that learns a move that boosts the special stat that could help it edge out the other moves.
4. ""But Bulbasaur is weak against the Psychic and Fire, which are two of the gyms!"" - this is honestly a terrible argument. Yes, Bulbasaur is weak to Psychic, but something that people fail to realize is that by the time you are at the 6th gym, you are likely to have a near fully made team by that time. Whenever people usually point this, they imply that Venusaur is the only Pokemon in your team, which is objectively just not going to be true by any means. Plus, to say that Blastoise and Charizard somehow do WELL against Sabrina is a complete lie. Cause, like, Lick and Twineedle were the only super effective move against Psychics back then. Just because Venusaur has a more tough time against Sabrina does not necessarily make Charizard's and Blastoises easy. In terms of Blaine, people tend to forget the fact that you need to surf to get to Cinnabar Island. You literally REQUIRE a water Pokemon that is super effective against Blaine to beat him. Plus, if you don't have a water type by the time you get to Blaine, then what in the hell are you doing? If Bulbasaur is somehow ""bad"" because he struggles against 2 gyms very much later in the game, then Charmander and Squirtle are even worse as they struggle against just as many gyms EARLIER in the game, with a less developed team.
5. ""But Exeggutor is the better grass type!"" - that would be true, except the fact that it isn't. See, the thing is with Exeggutor is that the only actual grass type moves it learns are Mega Drain and Solar Beam. The former is a move with only 40 base power that doesn't gain the guarantee of a crit like Razor Leaf, and the second requires two turns to perform (on another note, Exeggutor doesn't learn Sunny Day in gen 1). You can't really argue that Exeggutor functions better as a grass type compared to Venusaur, because... well, he just does NOT satisfy grass moves as well as Venusaur does with Razor Leaf. Exeggutor is a better PSYCHIC type, but Venusaur isn't... a psychic type. Plus, there are better psychic types in Kanto anyway then \*coughs\* Alakazam. FURTHERFURTHERMORE, if you were to argue that the reason Venusaur is somehow bad because Exeggutor is ""better"" (which it isn't), then by that logic, once again, Charmander and Squirtle are also somehow worse. Charizard is vastly inferior to Arcanine, as not only does Arcanine have 20 more in BST, but he also has the advantage of not having a sucky dual typing (that Charizard can't even use since he doesn't learn fly). As for Blastoise, Starmie (which is faster, actually HAS water type moves unlike Exeggutor to Blastoise, as well as Psychic), and Gyarados (which has a higher BST, higher special stat, etc...) are both better options than Blastoise. 

Good luck.",2020-03-17 17:36:15,changemyview
"CMV: conservatives get way more ""triggered"" over their choice issues, like gun control and funding the military as much as humanly possible, than feminists do over any feminist issue","It may be useful to define exactly what I mean by ""triggered"". I think the best way to describe it would be having such a strong emotional reaction to a differing viewpoint that you either act out with unnecessary hostility or make flawed arguments, but most importantly you shut down completely and close yourself off to meaningful dialogue. I mean simply letting your emotions get the better of you. 

I admit this is definitely driven by personal impressions and what I've observed, but the kicker here for me is that almost every feminist out there actually has a lot of educated reasoning behind what they believe and that entire schools of thought and books have been written on the topic of why it matters. And while I see lots of books ABOUT war, I certainly don't see anything near the same level of intellectual debate and interest into why it matters.

Think about how easily a conservative links ""we should slash military funding"" to ""we should completely shut down our military, put hundreds of thousands of people out of work, fail to support trade, fail to oppose any military might"" etc. That's a fundamentally triggered response right there, simply to think that decreasing funding, which by definition could be as little as 0.0001% of the overall budget, automatically means something way more drastic. I have seen this so many more times than I've seen a feminist get ""triggered"" and leave reason at the door.

Ex boyfriends who clearly weren't right for me, well, they weren't my best friends because I did not trust them the way I trust my husband. My best friends in that case were there for me to complain about the boyfriend. This is not the case for my husband; for everything, I go to him directly. I do everything with him; I can't imagine going on a trip with someone else etc. let alone leaving him behind.

Those of you who disagree, tell me. Why do you feel you're in the right relationship if your SO isn't your best friend? What is it about a same-sex best friend that your SO doesn't fit? You have fun with many people in different ways, sure, but what's the point of having an SO if you don't have more fun with that person?

Moreover, what's the point of dating someone if they aren't your best friend?

CMV: Many Neoliberals Care About Political Aesthetics and Social Order More than Actual Traditional Liberal Values/Helping People,"Whether you are far-left or center-left, you can agree that you have not been pleased with the Trump administration. There are many reasons to be displeased, after all. I don't need to list Bad Trump Things, but just super briefly:

-Tax breaks for the rich while cutting social programs

-Aggressive new interpretations of immigration law + escalation of bad policy

-Horrible foreign policy decisions in Iran and elsewhere

Obviously, I could go on and on. There is *plenty* of substantive stuff to criticize Trump about. But when you listen to neoliberal/centrist discussions of Trump, they don't seem to be focused on his policy decisions or on how help people affected by those decisions. At the LCD level, you have the people who share low-info memes deriding him as ""the cheeto"" and all that kind of shit. 

But then even the supposedly more sophisticated discussions often seem to focus on aesthetics &gt; helping real people. The center-left/neoliberal response to Bernie Sanders and the online left is the perfect illustration. Right now the front page of this very sub has a post about how working class people who are frustrated under Trump need to have better manners online, and basically should be banned if they don't improve their manners. The thread includes 0 concession that hey, maybe these people have a reason to be aggrieved, and we should prioritize helping them over tone policing them.

This trend can be seen everywhere from the Dem debate stage to the NYTimes front page. You had Pete Buttigieg who was more focused on Bernie's tone than on why that tone was resonant to so many struggling Americans. You have countless articles like this one where the Ivory Tower tries to de-legitimize leftist voices https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/29/us/politics/bernie-sanders-chapo-trap-house.html

How could my view be changed here? Maybe someone could show me some prominent neoliberal/centrist voices that don't succumb to this sort of tone policing, to show this problem doesn't envelope the entire center-left? Maybe someone could try to explain why those complaints are justified, though I don't think my view can be changed on that.

"CMV: Sub-reddits that call for ""eat the rich,"" ""guillotines for billionaires"" or ""euthanise the boomers"" is a form of incitement of violence, and should be quarantined","Ok I understand that this is a touchy topic for a lot of socialists and anarchists, but this is something I genuinely have trouble wrapping my head around, and I'm open to hearing another perspective on this...And it's very possible I'm perhaps the one whose missing the point

So to centre this discussion a little more so that it stays on topic, here are a few basic premises that I will start with (feel free to challenge these if you feel they're incorrect)

1. Regular occurrences of incitement of violence on a sub-reddit warrants a quarantine 
2. Incitement of violence as defined by reddit site-wide rules [https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/78p7bz/update\_on\_sitewide\_rules\_regarding\_violent\_content/](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/78p7bz/update_on_sitewide_rules_regarding_violent_content/)  
entails quote,*""****Going forward, we will take action against any content that encourages, glorifies, incites, or calls for violence or physical harm against an individual or a group of people****; likewise, we will also take action against content that glorifies or encourages the abuse of animals. This applies to ALL content on Reddit, including memes, CSS/community styling, flair, subreddit names, and usernames.""*
3. Rhetoric such as ""eat the rich,"" ""guillotines for billionaires"" and ""euthanise the boomers"" indirectly/directly advocate or suggest violence upon a group of people, either ironically or unironically

So starting with premise no.3, if we accept that these types of rhetoric in one way or another suggest some form of violence upon particular groups, the question becomes does it matter whether or not if it's done ironically. 

If it's done unironically, then it seems to me to qualify as at least a form of mild incitement to violence. If done ironically, then there comes two issues;

* The biggest problem with irony is that very often, the only person who can truly tell if something is said ironically, is the person who said it. More often than not, when the presence of irony is not  made clear and is instead left ambiguous, it will be simply taken onboard and interpreted according to whatever the viewer's perspective and which disregards the OP's original intent. In such a scenario, it's a much wiser policy to simply treat the rhetoric as how it would be interpreted by the average reasonable person.   
An example of this would be the banning of the sub-reddit ""GamersRiseUp,"" that regularly had memes advocating for genocide and inciting violence, through hate speech against minority groups, but would always hide against this ambiguous guise of ""irony"".  

* Secondly, there's the simple fact that irony is hardly a defense for rhetoric that suggests/incites violence. If I were to say, ""Kill people of group \[x\],"" it hardly makes what I said anymore appropriate because I followed it up, when called-out on it, with ""I was being ironic/I didn't really mean it""...Especially when this is online, and tone can't be readily interpreted...

So therefore, following on from premise 3, such rhetoric still count as incitement or suggestion of violence regardless of whether it is done ironically or unironically. 

Now from what I've read, there's generally two other major rebuttals against this, that states such forms of incitement of violence is either permissible for not being major or threatening enough, or that it is justified since it's more or less a call to self-defence...and they go along the lines of;

1. Rhetoric as listed in the title, is permissible since there haven't been any people in the United States taking it so seriously as to go ahead and physically attack baby boomers or rich people, and therefore such rhetoric shouldn't be counted as genuinely threatening.   
In addition, rich people hold a higher socio-economic class to most people and are thus at the top of the socio-economic hierarchy, and therefore any attacks on them are acceptable since it is ""punching up"" and not ""punching down"".   
Note: (A similar argument used to justify why rhetoric such as ""mayocide"" or ""white people are \[insert insult\]"" or anti-white pejoratives while not a good thing, aren't that big of a deal and is permissible)  

2. The rhetoric listed in title, while incitement to violence, are acceptable/justified since they're  calls to justified violence/self defence...  
 For those not too well-versed in socialist theory, the idea is that the rich and capitalists are actually stealing wealth from labourers every time a product is sold....since according to Marx, the worker should own all profits derived from it since it was only through the worker's efforts was the product produced. The factory and tools that contributed to making the product, were also made by other workers, and so on and so on. The rich then enforce this ""theft"" by using the violent force of the police and the military to ensure workers can't take back from the rich ""what they supposedly rightfully own.""   
...Therefore, the argument is that if the rich doesn't want to give the wealth back to the workers, it is on the same level as if an armed robber broke into your house took all your basic necessities and made sure you stayed in poverty for the rest of your life. From that paradigm, the argument is therefore any calls to violence against the rich, who are reluctant to give away their wealth, is a call to self-defence and thus justified and shouldn't be classified as incitement of violence of the bad kind.

Rebuttal 1 doesn't hold up when you realise that a lack of real life enactment of a particular violent message, does not permit said violent message. Incitement of violence against a group rarely targeted in past historical events, is still incitement of violence. In addition, while ""punching up"" is far less impactful than the effect of ""punching down,"" that doesn't make the act of punching anymore appropriate. There's a reason why we hold on to the ideal of treating people equally before a court of law, and why even if a small 100 pound man threw a punch at Dwayne ""the rock"" Johnson, we still classify it as assault and inappropriate.

Rebuttal 2 also isn't an adequate argument since it relies on a moral premise grounded in the rejection of private property. While at least in the US, private property is enshrined both as an ideal and protected by law. Whether such laws or ideals are morally justified is an irrelevant question, since incitement of violence is the incitement of any sort of violence held as illegal, and since reddit is headquartered in the US, it also follows the laws and jurisdiction of the US.   
In other words, whether or not I feel my incitement of violence is justified, doesn't change the fact that it is still incitement of violence. Otherwise reddit would have to be debating with the moral premises and justifications of every ideology, religion whenever supporters advocate for illegal violence, before reddit can ban/or quarantine.

Therefore, such rhetoric as ""Eat the rich,"" ""guillotine billionaires,"" or, ""euthanise boomers"" ironically or unironically should indeed be treated as incitement of violence...They aren't acceptable as calls of self-defence nor permissible from designation as ""not a big deal,"" and sub-reddits that regularly enable or support such rhetoric should be quarantined following on premise 1 and premise 2.",2020-03-17 13:55:57,changemyview
"CMV: The government SHOULD bail out the airline industry, but at [near] usury interest rates","Robert Reich [has decried](https://twitter.com/RBReich/status/1239724170440773633) the possible bailout of the airline industry, giving statistics about how they used their available money since deregulation to boost executive profits.

The idea of cutting off corporate bailouts is appealing, but taxpayers would be walking away from a potential funding source for desirable social programs. I am not aware of any significant interest being generated by previous bailouts, like those to the banks or auto industry.

Given that, I would think, the government is the only body with enough money on hand to provide a bailout of that size, we have an opportunity to make it worth our while with high interest. I know private lenders are (correctly) legally barred from charging excessive interest rates, but I am unclear on whether these same laws would apply to a bailout from the government.

If rates exceeding private lender legal limits are allowed, they should be charged, and if not, the government should bail out the airline industry but at the highest possible interest rate in and allocate that money to unemployment during the economic downturn.",2020-03-17 13:19:02,changemyview

CMV:If you are a daily weed smoker and you aren't Vaporizing or dabbing you are wasting money,"I'd like to start this off by saying I love smoking and I think that everyone is entitled to their preferences. However according to my research when cannabis is combusted (smoked) you only get 40% of the body's THC content whereas when cannabis is vaporized or dabbed you get 70% of the THC content. My personal experience with this is that I just got an waxpen and I am getting higher on much less material which will save me cash. I know that wax is more potent than flower and at the dispensary wax is much more expensive but in terms of thc/dollar they are comparable. Thus, the higher % of Thc that is absorbed makes the wax more economical. To wrap it up a wax pen or dry herb vape are investments for stoners, dry herb vapes in particular can be $100 for a quality product, however the improvement in the amount of THC/gram consumed makes the investment worth it for anyone who smokes regularly.

"CMV: Money was a tool that was created to be subservient to humanity's needs. Now, human needs are put aside, often as secondary to the importance of money. Society needs a re-calibration of it's priorities.","I feel like we have completely lost sight of history, that once money did not exist - and like any other *tool* we have created, it was created to benefit us - our purpose as humans is not to benefit *it.*  Yet, many lives and livelihoods are continually ruined or lost because of purely ""economic"" issues.

**If we have the resources** (i.e., the available labor, technology, infrastructure - and let's be a real - a virtually unrealized potential of full automation) **to provide everyone on Earth with their basic needs** (shelter, food, clean water, medical care, education) - **then why should money be capable of stopping that from happening?** 

I think we get lost in the numbers, get lost in history, and trust too much in the ""experts"" who aren't looking at the bigger picture - and certainly aren't examining their own priorities.  I think that when you are holding a hammer ($), everything starts to look like a nail.  We get so trapped in looking at things a certain way, and go with the herd mentality so easily - without questioning whether certain assumptions and values are actually true, right, or beneficial - and without appreciating where those ideas actually stand in relation to the whole big picture of human history.  And, this particular effect of herd mentality, as a dangerous aspect of human psychology, may be one of the prime factors that is preventing the evolution of the human species from one of massive oppression, inequality and strife to one of a future where many of the problems we've dealt with for many, many, many generations can become a memory.

I think when folks' survival feels like it's constantly on the line living paycheck to paycheck, the notion of sitting down and figuring out what is going on - a prerequisite to even consider somehow becoming part of a widespread systemic change - seems like too much work, and too hopeless - too unlikely to yield results.

But, I think we, as humans, with our potential for innovation, can solve these problems, and others - beginning perhaps with a spreading elucidation and discussion of sorting out our priorities to put humans lives and livelihoods first.  We have to go back to the basics and look at some of our foundational assumptions - and be capable of questioning them, as a society, together.

CMV: Stock buybacks are bad and should be banned,"Back in the day when the economy grew 3% a year instead of this measly 1-2%, and wages grew about 2-3% a year for everyone, it was illegal in the US for corporations to buy back their own stock from shareholders. It was believed that companies buying their own shares would allow them to increase the value of their stock without adding any value to their company or to the economy.\* The Reagan administration lifted that rule, and now companies now spend 3/5ths of their profits-- equivalent to about 4-5% of GDP-- on buybacks every year! Since they could be investing that money in innovation or raises for their workers, I don't see how that's good or useful for the economy, and it might even be why the economy isn't doing as well as it used to. Is there some benefit of buybacks that I overlooked?  


\*For those who don't know economics, this happens because while a buyback doesn't reduce the total value of a company, it reduces the number of owners.

CMV: There is no legitimate reason why Marijuana shouldn't be fully legalized across all mainland United States after the conclusion of the 2020 presidential race.,"**DISCLAIMER:** This is a former college essay of mine, It is a bit of a study. I want to see if anyone can give me an actual argument against the legalization of marijuana. Of course, I am open to all discussions to be had about the said topic which has of course been discussed here numerous times. Let's dive back in!  



**Marijuana Usage and its Legality** 

* In the United States, the discussion of marijuana still remains a polarizing topic of debate and criticism. To this day the drug THC or marijuana is still classified as a Schedule I drug.  Specifically, these drugs have been listed as such because of their high potential for abuse and their lack of safety, even under medical supervision. This classification would put it alongside drugs such as heroin, ecstasy, and LSD. Meanwhile, drugs such as cocaine, meth, and oxycodone remain as schedule II drugs, which are considered to be less dangerous. States such as Colorado, California, Nevada, and Washington have decriminalized the use of marijuana for recreational and medicinal purposes, in my opinion, marijuana should not still be listed as a schedule I drug if certain states have the right to legalize it. 

* In addition, the adverse health effects of marijuana have been thoroughly documented, showing that its effects are much less harmful than the substances it shares with its schedule 1 status. The discussion of marijuana has produced an extensive history of propaganda dating back to the 1930s that sought to undermine and spread fear-mongering against minorities, linking the drug to acts of violence, and other deviant behaviors among youth.  If marijuana can still be able to remain a Schedule 1 drug, then it must be proven that there is no medicinal benefit with its usage. How can marijuana with its history of dishonest media portrayal sponsored and supported by pharmaceutical companies still remain prohibited while an increasing majority of Americans support its legalization? 

**Public Opinion**

* As public opinion over the usage of marijuana shifts toward more lenient sentiment over the usage of the drug. Many states still hold firm to their staunch practices in keeping the drug illegal. In the most recent polls, a whopping sixty percent of Americans are in support of marijuana legalization (Subbaraman). Twenty-one states permit the usage of medical marijuana, and eight states have legalized it for recreational use. Over the last fifty years, the pendulum has swung from one extreme of all-out prohibition to a state where more tolerance is being shown. As public consciousness shifts, the drug still remains in the hands of political officials who cater to conservative thinking. The federal government still states that marijuana is illegal to pursue and cultivate. Since certain states supersede the federal law by allowing the sale of marijuana, the influence it has on other states who ban it cannot be ignored. Any state law that conflicts with the federal laws stands as a preemptive obstacle or a conflict of interest with the federal law. States like Colorado and California can interrupt the federal government's attempts at eliminating transactions in the interstate commercial substances market. Meaning that the decriminalization of marijuana in some states will ultimately have a spillover in bordering states. The FDA is failing in its enforcement and certain states can openly violate the ruling of federal law by imposing its own regulations. Is the federal government's objective to stop trafficking or to stop recreational usage? Currently, their stance is leaning at the former, but as states increasingly legalize it for recreational use it is likely to get muddled in trafficking cases, making enforcement all the more difficult. As public sentiment shifts with new legislative efforts to ease restrictions states should review the more liberal policies adopted by Colorado and others. 

**States**

* Marijuana legalization has been held exclusively to the state's decision process. A disconnect still remains between the federal government and the state's choice to keep the drug under its control. The DEA has stated that marijuana has no current medicinal value and should remain listed as dangerous. In contrast to this stance, the FDA has documents describing how the drug is in fact relatively safe. Common arguments against its usage are that it causes lung cancer, has links to mental illness, can be as addictive as tobacco and that it is often used as a “gateway drug.” The evidence cited by the FDA stated that research does not support, “direct causal relationship between regular marijuana use and other illicit drug use”(DOJ). It has also been thoroughly debunked that it doesn't cause lung cancer. Large studies by the FDA concur that “There was no significant association between lung cancer risk and passive smoking” (Chadwick). Sandeep Grover, a researcher for the Indian Journal of Psychiatry states that “Current evidence indicates that there is a clinically significant association between cannabis use disorders and psychotic syndromes, depression, anxiety, and possibly mild cognitive impairment. However, the nature of this association is often not clear.” In terms of connections to cognitive impairment, the author also states that “Their clinical significance remains uncertain.” The evidence does link cannabis abuse to psychotic disorders, the same could equally be used toward alcohol abuse. Doctor Laurence M. Westreich of Clinical Focus states “Alcohol use disorders can cause or exacerbate a wide variety of psychiatric syndromes, from schizophrenia to the anxiety disorders.” While the clinical evidence toward alcohol remains almost certain, the same evidence surrounding marijuana remains skeptical.

**Campaigns** 

* Long has marijuana been treated as a harmful substance in America. The early 19th century saw some of the largest most egregious campaigns aimed at delegitimizing and targeting the use of marijuana. One successful campaign against the criminalization of marijuana was shown through the film “Reefer Madness” during the 1930s. This film along with other anti-marijuana campaigns sought to strike fear into the users often stating that the drug was a gateway to more terrible things and that it caused hallucinations, enforced sexual promiscuity, and destroyed the human spirit. In 1931 twenty-nine states had already outlawed the use of marijuana. Commissioner of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics Harry J. Anslinger played a part in this, often stating that the use of “evil weed” led to killings, violence, and insanity. As a result, the marijuana tax act was passed in 1937 criminalizing marijuana use throughout the United States. This criminalization would create numerous problems in the criminal justice system, often seeing offenders dealt with long prison sentences. The 1970s saw more leniency, and president Jimmy Carter even endorsed the decriminalization of marijuana during his term, but numerous other campaigns aimed at juvenile delinquency reinstituted the fear. Ronald Reagan signed three acts during his term further lengthening the penalties of marijuana possession. For example, the possession of a hundred marijuana plants carried the same sentence as the possession of a hundred grams of heroin at this time. This pattern of long sentencing for petty drug offenses would continue into the 21st century.  The history of misinformation surrounding marijuana has been rampant all throughout society. In my opinion, the institutions we have been founded on have failed us by allowing for mass incarceration, and inadequate research on the drug and its effects. 

**How we can move forward**

* The legality of marijuana is an issue that will continue to impact all Americans. It is important to understand that drug agencies and government special interests have played a large role in altering our opinions about marijuana. Scientific evidence often leans in the opposite direction, stating that the adverse effects are no worse than alcohol when abused. Fear-mongering citing its dangers has been so frequently debunked and states now face the dilemma of becoming at odds with the federal government because of their decisions to legalize it.

CMV: Jesus Wasn't A Good Person,"**Why would a good person want to be worshipped as a god?**

The reason why I'm arguing this is because he created a cult and manipulated the poor into believing that he is a god. He actually shows some signs of psychopathy.

According to psychology today, here are 7 characteristics of a psychopath. [https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/communication-success/201810/7-characterisitics-the-modern-psychopath](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/communication-success/201810/7-characterisitics-the-modern-psychopath)

*“If you repeat a lie often enough, it becomes accepted as the truth.”* —attributed to various sources

This is self explanatory, he convinced people that he is a god.

""In their desire for ever more power (over relationships, organizations, or society at large), many sociopaths and psychopaths will literally make up and say anything in order to achieve their aims. Blatant lies, distortions, deceptions, broken promises, and blaming the victim are just some of the common devices used to enable the sociopath or psychopath to advance his or her aggressive and unscrupulous schemes. Instead of making factual statements based on reality, sociopaths and psychopaths repeat lies incessantly to distort. Solid evidence is ignored and dismissed with contempt.""

* **Lack of Morality and Rule Breaking**

*“Rules are meant to be broken; that’s how you WIN.”* —Anonymous

The reason why Jesus received the death penalty is because of rule breaking

""Most people have a basic sense of right and wrong. In general, we may agree that kindness is right, and cruelty is wrong; healthy relationships are right, and toxic relationships are wrong; honest hard work is right, and stealing and cheating are wrong. Sociopaths and psychopaths, however, have little or no sense of morality. They are more inclined than the general population to violate human rights or have brushes with the law. They believe that “might is right” and “rules are meant to be broken.” Human and ethical considerations are abhorred and viewed as weaknesses. In short, they have little or no [conscience](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/ethics-and-morality).

On occasions when sociopaths and psychopaths do mention morality or “fairness,” it is done either for the sake of appearance or to conveniently forward their own self-serving agenda. Fake morality is used as a manipulative device, rather than genuine value. ""

Social distractions will still exist amongst gender segregated populations but at least a portion of it is eliminated in the confides of the schooling environment. Also there is a general trend towards more favorable outcomes for females in the current coed schooling structure than males. Males in females in formative years, especially during puberty, have different needs and by having a more isolated or targeted approach more students needs can be met. Obviously education can't be tailored entirely for the individual but by moving more in that direction we can improve outcomes for everyone.",2020-03-17 03:44:59,changemyview

Cmv:The new FF7 remake is kinda ...meh...(based on completed demo),"I know its a unpopular opinion,  but ive been a major fanboy of Cloud's adventure since i was 4, so it holds a major nostalgia factor in me.
  
I understood when the project was undertaken that there would be change, and that i wouldnt get the same experience.  But once i got beyond the nostalgia i realised the game kinda sucks. 
      
I mean specifically the gameplay, the main thing that makes the difference between a movie and a game.
The gameplay is...how to say. If youve been a fan of final fantasy and follow the behind the scenes you know what happened and why some people would find it stale. Its the same gameplay as FF7 Crisis core had, just with several party members, like FF 12 had... and you realise quickly, they didn't really re ""make"" anything.
    
Graphics are a slight improvement on the recent games, music is always a classic but, these both already existed before the game did. I myself, saw a live performance of the music. 
    
The animations are basicaly the same as dissidia/crisis core and Barett isnt exactly hard to animate.
    
The fighting seems, dull. I heard people complain that the boss was hard, but having done it in the original, i know it was the same difficulty.
In fact i find it slightly easier than the original, since the original didnt allow me to dodge.
    
I feel like i played this game already and there just wasnt enough done to it to make it worth a new 70CDN . Like i said, the gameplay is a carbon copy from mediocre titles, with just flashy graphics, which for square enix ...well its the one things they fail at.
  
What am i missing that is making fans and new players freak out? I love this series, i own a sword Cloud wields IRL, he is the poster above my bed, i dont get why i was not blown away when all i see is praise for it. I really wished Square would have blown me out with this one, they have been having severe issues behind the scenes and the more time goes ,the less i respect em. From the FF13 release to uncovering why theres 3 13s theres a heavy history post FF10 of producers meddling in directors works and only hurting the product.

"CMV: If we weren't exposed to sexuality/romanticism, we wouldn't be sexual beings.","# So what does that tell us? Why do we have to be influenced by something that's apparently a natural urge?

I think sexuality and romanticism is shoved in our faces so much so we will want to have sex and procreate. 

Yes, we have sexual organs but people only seem to become sexual beings once they're exposed to it in some way. I have no idea how the early humans were exposed to it but I don't think any of us would be drawn to sex if we were never exposed to it. Idk, I'm just looking for evidence that we would still become sexual beings regardless of if we were exposed to it or not.

Same goes for the desire to procreate. I don't think we would have a desire to procreate if we weren't exposed to sugarcoated images of the family life or parenthood. People also only seem to want children once they're dissatisfied with life or pressured by their peers and want to fit in.

The illegitimate state of Israel continues to launch airstrikes at Syria, my home country, all while parading themselves as morally superior to the other nations in the region.

&amp;#x200B;

Jews continue to effectively dominate the economies of many nations, all while getting offended at the Happy Merchant stereotype that they have embodied, and also completely ignoring all the hate that Muslims get for embodying the exact same stereotype.

&amp;#x200B;

And once again, criticizing any of these people is prohibited.

Every time I see one of these hook-nosed demons, I cringe and try to physically separate myself from them, not out of fear but rather out of disgust for their actions against my people and the moral high ground they claim to have acquired, all because of shit that happened over 70 years ago (shit that they deserved, if you ask me, but that's a different post for a different time).

I do not wish violence on anyone, including Jews, but I will proudly state that I genuinely hate Jews and unconditionally view them as adversaries. If you look through my post history, you will also see that I have a dislike for Americans, but even that is just a simple dislike for the way that they behave without any real hatred involved; with Jews, I actually hate them for the abhorrent things they have done to the Palestinians and Syrians, as well as the way they've cheated themselves into a position where they are immune to criticism.

CMV: Self-worth does not exist.," Just  in the same way that you can't write ""100 million dollars"" on a piece  of paper and expect it to be worth that without everyone else agreeing  to it, you cannot set your own perceived value yourself.  
All value derives from what is universally agreed upon by others, be it monetary, sentimental, or the worth of a person.

Self-worth is, then, a delusion or a coping mechanism and not real.

  
Just as with everything else in the world, no one cares what you think of yourself, all they care is what value you bring to them. Not even one's family would love them if they didn't at the very least love them back. We do not give value to things that we derive no value from.  


If someone says ""I have a huge self esteem because I'm very kind / intelligent / hardworking"", then what value would they have if they were the last living being on the universe and they had nothing to apply their kindness / intelligence / hard work? None, because value cannot be set by oneself.

CMV: The Existence of Infinities Prove that the Universe is Not a Simulation,"A popular idea these days is that the entire universe is a simulation in some highly sophisticated supercomputer. I would argue that the apparent infinities present in the universe (e.g. the infinite dilation of time when traveling at light speed; the (hypothesized) infinite density of matter at the singularity of a black hole; the apparently infinite expanse of the universe) falsify this model, as infinite computing power would required to render infinities. Thus, one would need an infinitely large computer, and such would then be indistinguishable from the actual universe.

Now, the caveat to this is that infinities themselves are theoretically impossible to prove. One cannot measure infinite density. One cannot travel infinite distance. So all we have is the appearance of them. However, given the mind-boggling values that constitute the universe - values which only ever seem to increase with time - the notion that any device even resembling what we would recognize as a computer could be generating all this becomes increasingly unlikely.",2020-03-16 21:17:40,changemyview

"CMV: The DNC, establishment Dems, and Biden camp don't need to make massive concessions to the progressive wing of the party to win POTUS or the Senate majority and can win both without the ""Bernie-or-Bust"" crowd.","With last nights debate in the books coming and going without any primary shaking revelations, it looks overwhelmingly likely that Biden wins the primary.  A lot of discussion now seems to be around what Biden and the establishment has to concede to win over the Bernie-or-Bust crowd.  I don't believe that Team Biden and the DNC need to sell out to the progressives to win POTUS and Senate majority and I think it would be a mistake to do so.

\- I don't think the electoral map has changed all that much since 2016.  This means that Biden only needs to win 3 or 4 Obama/Trump states back.  If you compare 2012 and 2016, 6 states voted for Obama and Trump.  Of those 6, 4 were decided by less than 1.5% (Florida, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Michigan).  That is less than 200,000 combined votes between the 4 states and those 4 states are 75 electoral votes.  You actually only need to flip 39 votes so you only need to win back 3/4.

\- I don't believe there are a ton of true blue Bernie-or-Bust.  First, the Bernie-or-Bust votes in California and New York and Massachusetts and Illinois don't matter.  There definitely aren't enough to tank those states.  And at the end of the day, most voters are going to do what they think is right for the country, which is to vote out Trump.  There are a handful of Bernie-or-Bust voters in the aforementioned 4 states that will impact the election, but I do think that can be overcome by voters that would never vote for Hilary (and will vote for Biden), the one's that want Trump out, and the voters who will be influenced by the next point (\*I say ""voters"" because I'm not convinced a lot of vocal Bernie-or-Bust advocates are voters\*).

\- The economic downturn we are running into is going to spell bad news for the incumbent party.  Historically, when the economy is on a downswing during election season, the people vote in the opposite party.  A lot of people I've spoken to say the American people aren't going to blame economy on Trump, I disagree.  I think that in September and October when we are still in a global recession people will blame the Trump administration for a slow recovery.  

I've heard people and pundits float out the idea of Liz Warren as VP as being a ""masterstroke"" that would unite the party and secure the election and I think the DNC shouldn't compromise that far.  I am not convinced that the DNC and the Biden camp need to ""meet the progressives in the middle"" to win POTUS or Senate majority.

To me this seems backwards. If you don’t bring value to the consumer then over the long term your shareholders will lose value. Companies that mainly focus on short term profit margins by using tactics like misleading advertising and price gouging might show a temporary large profit margin, and a subsequent increase in their stock price, but this will not be sustainable over the long term. If the company focuses on bringing value to the consumer through honesty, integrity and providing a solid product value they will be sustainable.

"CMV: Taxation is not ""Theft""","I see the phrase ""taxation is theft"" fairly often among forums and my peers. While I understand the general sentiment behind it (that it is mandatory/involuntary) I nonetheless think that is an oversimplified statement that is just not true. Here is why:

Googling the definition of ""theft"" yields it as ""the act or crime of stealing."" If you google the definition of ""Steal"" you get the following: 

""take (another person's property) without permission or legal right and without intending to return it.""

Going on that here is my logic

1. Taxes are taken **legally**
2. Inhabiting the country you are taxed in is tacit **permission** for the government to take that money.  
3. Taxes are not **taken without intent to return it** per se. We do enjoy a ton of luxuries and utilities supported by our tax dollars. Roads, National defense, even Social Security and Medicare to name a few. In a way, taxes are money taken ""with the intention of returning it""
4. For democratic countries: laws are put into place by elected officials which were put into office by voting to make such decisions like managing taxes. Theoretically, we could all choose to elect only officials that would do away with taxes altogether so long as we as a people don't mind losing all the perks (something that no majority would ever agree with). Therefore, the fact that we have not done that is another reiteration of point #2. We do give permission for the government to take taxes.

I recognize that the counterargument to #1 is ""well they are taken by the people that make the laws, so it's not quite legitimate."" To that I say see point #4.

Whenever I go between floors I try to take stairs.  IF they're available, I'll use escalators.  When I use them, I use the steps.  If someone is in front of me just standing on the escalator (not moving), I'll wait patiently, but the rule for escalators is that you're supposed to use the steps.  Escalators are not meant to stop people from using their feet, they're meant to decrease the number of steps between floors.  

There are some cases where people do things that require them to stand still: look at their smart phones, tie their shoes, and so on.  And, in some cases, people should stand still on them (mobility issues, luggage, etc...), but most should use the steps provided.  As in other parts of the world (and some in the U.S.) people who are not using the steps stand to the right and those climbing use the left.

CMV: Occasional self harm is not worse than sometimes drinking alcohol,"I have been struggling with this issue for some times. And I thought in my mind seems to tell me that self harm is a mechanism no different to drinking, thus as long as I could control it it isn’t a big deal. I recognise that my views are not entirely correct but couldn’t pin point exactly why. 

My main argument is that it’s when you’re addicted to something, it starts harming you. This idea should apply to alcohol, self harm and even for other drugs used recreationally. If you could keep it under control, there is no harm in indulging yourself a little after a stressful day at work, or when you’re facing a rough path in life.

CMV: Gender differences in interests and feelings DO have biological cause,"Firstly, **I'm not denying that they also have environment and societal causes.** My view is that the psychological genders differences habe **both** biological and societal causes. 

For example, my view is that the claim : 

&gt; In a perfectly equalitarian large society, without gender roles, gender expectations and gender stereotypes : there would be \~50% of female engineers and \~50% of male nurses (by \~ I mean + or - 5% depending on the statistical fluctuations) 

Is completely false, I personally think that the male/female ratio within engineers would still be unbalanced in a society free of gender stereotypes (iId say around 75/25 or even 85/15, but it's just a guess).

My view doesn't come from nothing, I've been really interested in the subject and read some articles : 

\[Sex differences in the brain: implication for explaining autism\](([http://irep.ntu.ac.uk/id/eprint/2710/1/219535\_PubSub1971\_Belmonte.pdf](http://irep.ntu.ac.uk/id/eprint/2710/1/219535_PubSub1971_Belmonte.pdf)) is in my opinion a very good article about this subject. 

It mentions (by quoting an article or a scientific study each time) :

\- Differences favoring males have been seen in  mental rotation test, spatial navigation, targetting (in adults or children). Boys are more likely to play with mechanical toys as children (it has also been replicated with vervet monkeys).

\- Differences favoring females on emotion recognition, social sensitivity, verbal fluency. Girls start to talk earlier than boys, are more likely to play with dolls as children.

\- Even though these differences could be explained by external factors (stereotypes, education,...). Experiments on animals suggest a biological cause.

I think that as men and women have physical differences (height, muscular mass, genitals), hormonal differences (testosterone) and it is epistemologically very costly to think that evolution somehow made men and women perfectly equal on a psychological level.",2020-03-16 11:29:16,changemyview
CMV: We are ridiculously close to an imminent economic collapse as a result of capitalism and populism (USA),"I am going to be careful with this post. I don't want this to be centered around a current topic which the mods have considered, rightfully so, to be at risk of spreading misinformation when discussed.

I want to be clear that my concern lies in many attitudes and events of the present day. I will go into greater detail, but to list a few: Xenophobia, anti-science, climate change, the military industrial complex, wealth inequality, automation. I am aware that this is a broad range of subjects, but hear me out.

I am, admittedly, a very anxious person. I want my view to be changed desperately. Lately, I feel like I need to start watching Doomsday Preppers. I don't want to resort to that... Lol. I am also young (24) and perhaps it is my perception of current events that makes me worry, without much first person perspective of the past to quell my fears.

ANYWAY

I have read that since the Cold War, we have began facing more and more crises since the turn of the century. In the US, we have faced 9/11 (ongoing war in the Middle East/War on Terror), the 2008 crash, and other current events. Arguably, xenophobia, Eurocentrism, and populism have also taken hold since the 2016 election. The same is replicated in the UK with Brexit. 

This is only in addition to the War on Drugs and consistent Western Imperialism. 

The overwhelming majority of voters in the US are post-retirement. Voter apathy among younger people  is ridiculously high. I fear that the majority of Americans feel disenfranchised with the establishment and this is only exacerbated by the current economic situation. We are soon going to be dependent on one another to survive. 

We are not taking appropriate measures to move away from Imperialism, Fossil Fuels, favoring corporations over the poor, wasting money on xenophobic ideas such as a wall at our southern border, and not backing science when it comes to vaccination, and again, climate change.

I feel like society as a whole in the Western world is close to collapse because society barely moves forward as a result of old wealth being pushed into our governments and steering this vessel.

I don't see any foreseeable future without violent revolution. I think often about the situation in Chile currently, where millions of people are rising against the establishment, and the straw that broke the camel's back was an increase in the cost of public transportation.

CMV: Sanders supporters should not vote Biden in the general.,"To give some background, I am a Bernie Sanders voter. I voted for him in the first election I was able to, in 2016, and I plan on voting for him again in 2020 once the primary happens in my state.  Hillary Clinton was not my first choice in 2016, but I held my nose and voted for her. In addition, I voted straight-ticket democrat in 2018, though I would never describe myself as one per se.

Currently I plan on either voting for the Greens in 2020 or leaving the President blank and voting straight blue for every other candidate. I have no plans for voting for Donald Trump. I live in a swing state, so it's not like my vote will have zero impact either way.

My reasoning for doing this:

1. Sanders correctly diagnosed the problems of the country as being the result of long-standing trends that go back long before Trump. Biden has explicitly said he wants to return to a status quo before Trump, which I view as a status quo that will inevitably produce another Trump in the future, one that may be more competent.

2. Biden offers little material change from the Trump presidency, and is overall a bad candidate (and has a few personal scandals to boot). The policies he supported during his time as Senator, as Vice President under Obama, and currently as a Presidential candidate offers very little change from much of the legislation currently passed by Trump. In addition, he has supported conservative policy in the past, such as voting for conservative Supreme Court nominees, and suggested that he might be open to a Republican running mate. Most of all he takes money from billionaire donors and corporations.

3. The Democratic leadership, as a rule, takes Sanders votes for granted. By becoming swing voters, those voters might be courted in elections in the future. If, instead, Biden wins the election than those voters may continue to be ignored.

4. From a strategic standpoint, 2022 is an important election for both the Senate as well as for governorships. Democrats hold plenty of vulnerable governorships in generally Republican or swing states, states that might vote for conservative challengers come 2022. In addition, Democrats do not have a good shot at winning the senate this year, but could potentially win it in 2022 as several blue and purple states with conservative incumbents come up for election. If instead 2022 is a conservative backlash, that could cripple the movement moving forward.",2020-03-16 09:42:07,changemyview

Rarely is the goal consensus or cooperative solution oriented action involving compromise. The goal seems to be to dehumanize, reject, distort one's intentions, and most importantly win or beat the other side. On top of that, the nature of politics requires a level of arrogance in belief that one should make decisions over or control another's life.

CMV: The White Male Patriarchy construction is an impediment to treating the equity issues affecting those same minority group that it pretends to speak for.,"The entire conceptual construction hinges upon righting historical wrongs, and then raising equity for the marginalised &amp; the suffering. It wrongly couches equity inside identity, and at a deeper level the idea of a retributive justice couches the idea of a constructive path forward for lifting the floor on human equity, which would primarily affect those historically oppressed &amp; is unequivocally the correct humanitarian goal. 

Its the wrong way around and it works against the latter goal to have both intertwined within a movement. They need to be differentiated.

(Its the difference between punishing a prisoner (USA 75% recidivism), and rehabilitating them(Norway, 20% recitivism). Im not saying which is right or wrong, or which is fair. Im just saying they have different results.)

It prioritises blaming &amp; shaming the benefactors of the historical oppression as opposed to genuinely trying to find solutions for those suffering right now, which are still primarily minorities. This need to label things such as 'white privilage', 'toxic masculinity' etc etc is unecesarrily divisive, splitting the population down the middle on basic issues which stem from equity based economic factors. It works as a complete impediment to the modern spirit of compassion present in Left Wing &amp; compassionate politics, its basically just tying the equity movement into a pretzel, shitting all over the discussion and stopping us from getting anything done.  


To be clear I'm not saying the historical oppression wasn't evil, im not saying it didn't primarily benefit white people, im not saying that minorities aren't still suffering from it. In fact Im saying minorities are some of the main victims of the economic disparities, which we now can't talk about because you guys got suckered into making it about men vs woman and white vs black. Its a racist, and straight destructive way to frame the topic of equity, compassion and advancing a society (lifting the floor of equity) for the most impoverished and affected, which is at heart the primary driver of this movement that we should pay attention too. it needs to be separated from the retributive and racist 'fuck whitey' undertones that are present through out this 'white male patriarchy' construction.

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr framing equity (which is the important discussion, and at the end of the day all anyone can reference when talking about living standards of minorities) in the couch of race and gender identity politics makes it a toxic quagmire, it so perfectly stagnates the discussion it might as well have been designed by a population control think tank.

The Church of Satan has a habitual practice called [the Black Mass.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Mass).

Animals cannot perceive the pain of others, so empathy does not concern them.","This thought I had originally started out as a comedy bit I was writing, where I would say long rant centered around, “I would rather have turtles eat our plastic and die than have humans suffer with paper straws.

CMV: Parents who go out of their way to stop their teens having sex do more harm than good,"Excluding religious reasons, I (23 m) genuinely don't understand why many parents go to such extreme lengths to stop their children having sex and exploring their sexuality. As someone who was a teenager not so long ago, let me assure you: whether you 'allow' it or not, teens are going to have sex, and you can't stop them!

I'm aware that many parents have strict 'open door' policies when it comes to their teens and their SOs - where sleeping in the same bed is completely out of the question. But really... what does that achieve? I don't get the logic behind this at all; this approach seems entirely counterproductive. Are people rally so naive to think their kids will just take a vow of celibacy until they reach legal adulthood? NO! They'll just go and do it somewhere else... Somewhere that could even put them in danger.

Surely, a more sensible approach is to have an open and constructive dialogue with teens about safe sex, contraception, consent etc., and facilitate a safe environment where they can 'do their business' with the knowledge that parents are nearby if something goes wrong or they feel like they are in danger? Surely that's a much better approach than giving teens no other option but to expose themselves to situations where they have no access to contraceptives, can be taken advantage of, or worse.

I'm not proposing that teens should just be allowed to fuck whenever and wherever - obviously a few ground rules surrounding discretion and respect for others in the home are essential! But at the end of the day, what would you prefer? That your kid has access to contraception, advice and a safe and supportive environment to have sex in? Or that your kid is forced to have sex in dangerous places and situations?",2020-03-15 22:46:09,changemyview
"CMV: if you're undergoing IVF, it should be legal to choose your baby's gender","YouTuber couple Count Dankula and Sue Hulk recently announced that they are going through the process of IVF in order to have a child. In [Dankula's latest video](https://youtu.be/0xW2Q0Z0OI4), he states near the end that one problem he has encountered is that, despite the fact it can easily be done, the laws governing IVF in Britain, where he and I both live, prohibit selecting the gender of the child.

I don't see why this should be illegal. One of the main benefits of IVF is that it allows you to avoid having a child with genetics you don't want them to have and/or ensure they have genetics you do want them to have. Why shouldn't you be able to do the same with gender?

I get why this would be a problem in a culture like India where having a son is far more desirable in terms of his future economic contributions, so I can understand it being illegal in those places where there is a problem with the gender ratio. But in the west our societies are structured differently and the only difference is that men tend to choose careers that have slightly higher pay, so having a daughter isn't really an economic disadvantage.

This means that allowing gender selection wouldn't mean couples would always go for a boy, and would likely go for both if they were receiving IVF more than once. And on top of that, IVF births are only around 1-2% of all births in most developed countries, so the impact on the overall gender ratio would be tiny at any rate.

Why shouldn't you be able to choose if you want a boy or a girl even though in this situation it can easily be done?",2020-03-15 22:15:43,changemyview

"CMV: For certain terminal diseases, deciding to end one's life should be considered honorable/ethical","It seems that assisted-suicide in the case of the very sick and elderly is slowly being accepted as an option, however it's far from being considered acceptable by most people, it's only used in extreme cases and it's by far not an option that's ""encouraged"" by society.

There's obviously an argument that taking one's life in the case of a very harsh but treatable condition is not a good or ethical thing, you are essentially causing pain to your loved ones and depriving your future self of pleasure for the sake of reliving momentary pain. 

However, it seems that with many conditions the ""treatable"" part is basically impossible or rather, the probability is so minor as to be inconsequential. Take for example any un-recoverable organ damage (e.g. kidney failure for someone that isn't eligible for a transplant due to age and/or the condition that caused the failure and/or other conditions that make transplant unlikely to succeed).

Even more so, there's many conditions where ""treatment"" exists but treatment only serves to prolong life, but doesn't improve the condition and places great strain upon the patient's care-givers and society as a whole (see cost of caring for the terminally ill). To use the previous example, think daily dialysis for someone with kidney failure.

I can see the argument as to why one would go ahead living in a ""miserable"" state for purely solipsistic reasons, in a ""This is the only life I can live, and once I'm dead there's nothing left"" kind of way. However this solipsistic viewpoint is one we don't encourage people to adopt under any other circumstances. We'd consider it just for e.g. a parent to save their children from death or from  a horrible fate at the cost of their own life, we wouldn't require it, but we'd consider the parent to have acted ethically or honorably. More over, we tend to think of our deeds as living on after we pass and the whole of society is based on the idea that people will act ethically even when there's no possibility of punishment (i.e. no personal downside for acting unethically).

Obviously there's a blurry line in terms of what constitutes a strain one one's family and loved ones and a strain on society, there's the same vagueness about what ""miserable"" is. But the there's certainly a case that the line can be drawn somewhere and that once and individual decides he is past said line, suicide should be considered the ethical route to take (given that the decision is backed up by e.g. doctors confirming the diagnosis and price of the treatment as well as by empirical evidence the patient gathers about how much time and emotional energy his care-givers are pouring into him).",2020-03-15 21:49:34,changemyview

So I'm not convinced that the selfish drive of greed is detrimental, as it's useful to motivate our lives toward improved well-being.  But if we were to increase our empathy for others, our greed would continue to motivate benefiting our 'selves' which would include everyone.  I understand empathy to be the feeling of compassion or connection with other people&amp;things, which looks passed our surface-level differences to connect on our similarities such as being humans with the same fundamental needs.",2020-03-15 21:23:51,changemyview
"CMV: Voting age should correspond with working age, and therefor taxation.","
In my opinion, you’re right to vote should correspond with your need to pay taxes. By this I don’t mean people that don’t pay taxes shouldn’t get a vote, but rather that everyone that pays taxes should be allowed to vote. Specifically this refers to people under the age of 18, as many of them meet the threshold to have to pay taxes, and do so. Is our country not based off opposing taxation without representation? Why should some of our population get no say in what is done with the money they pay to the government?",2020-03-15 20:08:58,changemyview
CMV: I disagree with ethical veganism," 

I  understand that if you think killing and inflicting suffering on humans  is wrong by default, it makes sense that the same principle would apply  to non-human animals, since there isn’t a reason(as far as I know) to  differentiate human and non-human pain. However, I don’t believe that  killing and inflicting pain is wrong by default. I think that those  things being wrong is actually the exception, not the rule, and that  there’s nothing wrong with killing per se.

The  way I see it, the is-ought gap is insurmountable, so there’s no  objective morality. But, there question remains, what do people live  for? Why do people take such pains to avoid death if there is no meaning  in the universe and nihilism is correct? I believe it is because people  have an intrinsic sense of purpose(this purpose not necessarily being  objective), even if they aren’t consciously aware of it. Actions can  only be “right” or “wrong” relative to this purpose. But more than that,  humans have both an individual purpose and a social/collective/national  purpose, since humans don’t have a separate existence from the  collective(basically, what it means to be a social animal). The  individual purposes that harmonise form the national purpose and those  which do not are excluded from it and may form their own nations. Note:  I’m using the word “nation” in an unusual way, but that’s not relevant  to ethical veganism. All you need to know is that your nation consists  of the people who share your collective purpose(in pursuit of a higher  value).

The only ethical  imperative in this subjective ethic being the achievement of the higher  value that is the individual’s purpose, which in turn combines with  others to form the national purpose, one has no reason to have any  ethical constraints when dealing with those who do not contribute to  your purpose. If you and I share a purpose, and are working to achieve  it, I generally shouldn’t murder you. But you contribute nothing to my  purpose, I may do as I wish with you.

Now,  applying this principle to animal ethics, since non-human animals  cannot strive either towards my individual purpose or my nation’s  purpose, I may do whatever I want to them, including eating them and  putting them through the industrial farming process.

Note:  A source of possible confusion is me talking about how you “should” do  things while rejecting objective ethics. I think you absolutely can say,  “I don’t want to follow your ethical system.” and you wouldn’t be  objectively wrong to do so. However, I think that you’d simply have no  reason, or less of a reason, to live, as you’re compromising the real  reason you want to live by not pursuing your purpose as efficiently as  possible. You’ll still have to answer the question of why you don’t just  sit there and eat ice cream until you die.

TLDR:  I don’t believe inflicting suffering on and killing non-humans is  unethical because I don’t believe there are any limits on what you can  ethically do to those who do not contribute to your purpose. These  animals don’t contribute to your purpose; they’re just resources for  your to use however your wish.",2020-03-15 19:47:58,changemyview
"CMV: A man’s value is directly proportional to his success with women, whether we’d like to admit it or not","The same traits that define a man’s success in his life (charisma, good looks, hard work, etc) are the same traits that define success with the fairer sex.

Charisma: I’m certain most people know that a boring person with poor social skills won’t advance very far in his career and will be even less successful in his sex life. So I’ll leave it at that

Good looks: Everyone also knows that attractive people have more sex on average. What’s probably not as well known is that people considered objectively attractive [earn more](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S016748701500046X?via%3Dihub) than their less attractive peers.

Hard work: while this trait alone doesn’t guarantee success, it’ll probably get you farther than being lazy. And it’s no secret that if a man wants a woman, or frequent casual sex, they’re gonna have to work for it. Men are expected to initiate and arrange all stages of courting. If they fail socially in any of these stages, their chances of success with the women fall dramatically. Not to mention they are probably competing with at least 5 other men for the same woman’s attention, so they better be willing to work for it.

To put it bluntly, a man’s value is tied to his dating/sex life. If you aren’t attractive to women you probably have less value than someone who is, for the reasons listed above.",2020-03-15 19:22:17,changemyview

CMV: Skin color is a preference when it comes to dating/talking,"I feel like every time i bring up that i usually like a certain skin color, i get called a racist or other things of the sort. I’m not really sure how it is racist because it’s just my preference. 

For context, i usually prefer a white girl as opposed to girls of other races. I don’t hate black, mexican, asian, etc. girls. To me i just like girls who are white way more often than I like girls of other races.

Really it is no different than liking a certain hair color, for context i like a girl with brunette or blond hair, i’m not really into girls with red or black hair or rainbow colored hair. It also works with eye color, this ones not really big for me as long as your eyes aren’t pitch black to the point where you are feeding off of my soul. Some people like height, I see girls being this up and guys get really butthurt over it, really it’s just that persons preference like everyone else has. Get over it like honestly if that person doesn’t like you for your height than it won’t work out anyways, I personally like a girl shorter than me and if there is a girl who says i’m too short for them(i’m 5’9) oh well it’s no big deal i’ll move on to the next girl since i don’t date anyways. I’m more of a snapper. On the flip side weight, girls you got to get over this, nobody should have super tight preferences and automatically expect to have someone and to fit everyone else’s preferences. I have a particular and somewhat specific preference but i don’t automatically expect someone to fill the role, i go out and look for those people on my own. For weight I would never date a fat girl, l i just don’t like that look. Some people do and that’s ok.

I just like girls who are known as the conventionally attractive people. Now I do see the argument that you can’t change skin color like you can most those other things but so what, I don’t think something(in my opinion) i’m genetically wired to like is bad. The same way gay people say they’re born gay because they believe they’re genetically wired that way.

Seeing as the brain is widely considered to be developing until the age of 25, in addition to the age to purchase alcohol, tobacco, and cannabis all being 21 in Massachusetts. So the question becomes when are citizens considered adults? Is it at 18 or 21? If its 18 why dont they have all their rights? If its 21 why are they allowed to vote before they're an adult.

CMV: There are no redeeming qualities in being a career politician.,"I feel like career politicians are just people that get rich for doing nothing. Most of the time they are corrupt and deceptive and take money from constituents and end up building massive wealth. Politicians are some of the richest people in the US and I feel like they don’t bring much value or innovation. As well as going into a profession to not make peoples lives better, but basically just try to prove they’re right and get elected, no matter the costs. I think the ego and mindset it takes to want to be a career politician is one that no one would reward.

I see them as master manipulators more than anything. 

Even the path to becoming a politician seems wrong to me. It’s very odd that families “breed” politicians. I see the Kennedy, bush, Clinton families as these weird redundant political breeding grounds. It looks like if your father/brother/husband whatever is a politician it automatically gives you the qualifications to become a politician. 

Also it is very unsettling to me that politicians try to act like they’re perfect. It’s unrealistic to think that politicians have never been drunk or tried drugs or done anything wrong. I am honestly looking forward to in 20 years or so when people that grew up with Snapchat and social media run for public office and everyone who didn’t like them in high school has an embarrassing photo/video of them saved on their snap save.

I am aware that at some point it’s just “well somebody has to do it.” But I can’t wrap my head around looking up to career politicians at all.

I feel like there has to be a big part of this that I am missing. Obviously I cannot say that every single career politician is bad, at the least extremely unaware of the real world, but I think overall I find no value or merit in people that choose to make a career out of politics.

The one redeeming quality that I believe is obvious is the ability to be a good public speaker. Even then I think only a handful of politicians are exceptional public speakers and most just know how to do it.

"CMV I believe the world is a form of hell, and we are the spirits/demons that were born here. Doomed to die, and what happens after that is only speculation.","This is a form of hell. 

A good example of what I mean is that in the Bible it describes man as sinners. It describes man as something that was once pure and incorrupt being rejected from an existence of bliss and no suffering into an existence of tons of pain and misfortune.

We are all flawed, we are all doomed to die, we are all corrupt.

Corruption feels good because it is wrong, sin is satisfying and empowering. But morals and purity are even more satisfying and empowering if you understand them and how they work.

Pain and suffering exist because this plane of existence is something that is broken. Completely devoid of anything that truly cares about us and loves us.

We suffer because we are flawed, corrupt, and unwhole. Also because we are living in a world that breeds suffering like the plague. Humans only care about themselves for this reason, people are selfish, cynical, greedy, and cruel, a lot of relationships they form aren’t real, and they live off of pleasures of sin. And the joys that this corrupt world offers. Evil and good are objective, that is most apparent in the human condition. 

We love and care and shed such beauty because we were made by something greater than what this world is capable of creating. This is why we are so strange compared to any other species on the planet, we were made in the image of a incredibly beautiful something. Whatever it is.

Good only exists because god exists. 
Evil is so abundant because the devil is real.

We are enslaved to money and work because of this broken system and universe.

CMV: A minimum wage increase to $15/hr is not the way.,"Let me preface this by saying that there is absolutely a problem with the amount of people in the United States that are barely able (or not able at all) to pay for essentials. I'm not arguing against that. 

This is going to be a long one.

My argument is that an increase in minimum wage, while it would help many people directly by increasing their pay, would also hurt other people, such as those that are young or unemployed.

There is also a large possibility of hurting the people the minimum wage is designed to help, by incentivizing or forcing companies to cut their hours, and spread out worker shifts. If companies don't do this, they will have to raise prices to cover the increase in payments they have to make.

Before I get into the details of my argument, how do I think we should help low income workers? Well, the problem is that there is a difference between their income and their cost of living, so instead of focusing on increasing their income, it should be sufficient to focus on lowering their cost of living.

1: Why would an increased minimum wage hurt the young and unemployed? Because it eliminates their bargaining power for employment. If a company has to choose between hiring two people for the same pay, they will hire the one that appears better qualified, that includes people who are older, or have had steady employment before. But if the company wasn't forced to hire at a certain wage, the younger, or previously unemployed person could enhance his bargaining power by offering to work for a lower wage, allowing him to make money that he otherwise wouldn't have. 

[A study from the European Economic Review concluding that a higher minimum wage contributes to slightly higher unemployment rates, but significantly higher for youth (15-24) unemployment.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014292113001104) 

[And an experiment demonstrating that an increase in minimum wage decreased hiring and hours worked of less productive people.](http://john-joseph-horton.com/papers/minimum_wage.pdf)

2: The explanation for an increase in prices is simple. As the cost in making a product goes up, the price that it's sold at also goes up, and a minimum wage increase is a direct increase in the cost of making a product.

[Study showing that a rise in the UK minimum wage contributed to a long-term increase in the price of goods made by low-wage workers.](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1475-5890.2010.00108.x)

3: On to the second half of my argument. How can we lower the cost of living in the United States? [According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/cesan.pdf), the largest expenditure by the average family or single person is on housing. So reducing the cost of housing would go a long way in reducing how much money you need to survive.

Why is housing so expensive? Because outdated government zoning laws reduce the amount of houses that can be built, reducing the supply of housing, increasing the price.

[Zoning laws reduce the number of houses built, especially in poorer areas.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0264837716310626)

[Government regulation also contributes to high housing costs.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780444595317000193) So updating these regulations would also help those that the proposed minimum wage target.

The second highest expense in households is transportation. Reducing the restrictions on the housing market will allow more houses to be constructed closer to people's workplace, reducing the cost of transportation.

4: The third highest expense in households is food, only slightly behind transportation. [A minimum wage increase would increase food prices](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1538-4616.2010.00339.x), lessening the impact of the wage increase, and hurting those that are unemployed.

5: Another expense that can't be ignored is healthcare. My stance on how these costs should be lowered takes a long time to explain, and would need a whole other CMV. But it revolves around deregulating the industry to [decrease costs](https://www.aha.org/guidesreports/2017-11-03-regulatory-overload-report), and to [decrease the barriers for new pharmaceutical companies](https://www.qmenta.com/is-regulatory-compliance-a-barrier-or-a-driver-for-healthcare-startups/). Having other countries pay when they use drugs developed in the US would also help drive prices for healthcare down.

To sum up. A raise in minimum wage, while it would help some people, will also harm others. We can solve the problem of a low income family not being able to afford basic things, and harm significantly less people.",2020-03-15 03:26:06,changemyview
CMV: Respectability politics and passing privilege should be pursued by marginalized people whenever feasible.,"So to give you all background, I am a young man on the autism spectrum. I was diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome, what is now known as *Autism Spectrum Disorder, Level 1* due to social skills impairment. At the time, I was living in the wonderful land of New York and was able to get speech therapy, occupational therapy, social skills classes, and psychotherapy all under the dime of New York taxpayers. 

Anywho, eventually some weird special education teachers told us that if we want to ""have opportunities"" in the future, we needed to ""stop stimming and pacing"" and try our ""best ability to no behave in unexpected manners"". I bought it so did my classmates. We did everything we could to ""pass as neurotypical people as possible"" and while I cannot speak for my classmates who I grew apart from by 2nd grade, I considered myself as a ""neurotypical passing guy in the spectrum"".

I then learned from a teacher about *respectability politics* and how while not ideal, is the best thing marginalized people, people with disabilities included, can do to ""blend in"" and avoid being targeted by ableist people. Then in 2010, I started to see the social justice activism/allyship movement rearing it's head in the pan-disability community. Terms like diversity, intersectionality, feminism, ""is not dating an autistic people ableist?"", Identity-first language, and all this other stuff that seems to be originated from disabled people who have taken to heart the social justice elements from feminists and LGBTQ activists and adapted it to their own community. ASAN, or the *Autistic Self Advocacy Network* was the biggest pusher of intersectionality and social justice for people on the spectrum.

Then in 2015, some brunette woman Amherst Schaeffer, some chick on the spectrum decided to share her own experience being ""autistic"" and how advocating for acceptance, self-determination, and self-advocacy is the best math moving forward for the Autistic community. She claimed that ""I am sick and tired of parents special educators and the vehement Autism Speaks speaking on behalf for us in a condescending manner, assuming we all cannot speak for ourselves because of a diagnosis.""

While I agree with some of what she said, blending in, passing, accepting the status quo, and avoiding pushing social justice in order to avoid alienating conservatives is a safer option. I talked to my GF who is transgender about this and she wholeheartedly agrees with Amherst because ""marginalized people should not have to blend in with the rest of society in order to avoid marginalization. In layman's terms nobody should try to suppress who they are on the inside just to avoid being victimized by haters. ""I agree for trans people, but people on the spectrum have to pass as neurotypical because autism is a behavioral condition that can impair quality of life due to others misconstruing stims and paces as threats or ""signs of severe mental illness"".

Now before I start the conversation, I would like to add that I am genuinely interested in considering on changing my view. The reason being is because I do see that principle of nobody should feel pressured or coerced into suppressing their identity just to avoid being marginalized or oppressed. However, I do not feel convinced that principle is true, yet. If someone can persuade me well enough, I may change my mind.

They have to realize they they harm moderate-left and progressive politicians more than they help them with their over correctness and obnoxious behavior.
They even push centrists, which are fed up with their bs, into the right wing.

Not everybody who wants closed boarders is a nazi.
Not everybody who is annoyed by the gender madness is a sexist.
Not everybody who thinks trans people are not women is homophobic.
Not everybody who drives a pick up denies the global warming.
Not everybody who thinks the islam has dangerous and harmful tendencies wants to oppress muslims.

A lots of people I know stopped voting for the green party and the sozial democrats (my countries left wing parties) because the far left parts of these parties became more and more obscure and sometimes even oppressive, since they labeled everyone a bad person who did not agree with their views.

* The education system is horrible. Most student are graduating not knowing basic things. Higher education is too expensive and there is no reason people should have  $100,000+ in student loans. All tuition should be capped and state schools should be lower cost or free. 

* Employees are treated like shit. Many people don't get any paid time off. Even when you do, it's limited to 12 days a year. We also are one of the few countries that only gives full-time employees two weeks of vacation a year. There is no such thing as work-life balance in this country because making companies/corporations richer is more important than people's lives.

CMV: Mainstream terminology for same-sex attraction (gay/lesbian) is highly euphemistic,"Lesbian referring to 'Sappho of Lesbos'.

Gay meaning 'happy'.

So male same-sex meaning happy, and female same-sex meaning of a given island. Talk about euphemisms.

I believe this highlights a lack of ability for our mainstream society to effectively engage with the root idea of same-sex relationships. Couching something in euphemisms seems to strongly indicate an hesitancy to fully acknowledge a topic, suggesting it is partially or at least remniscent of a taboo.

Some notes (not core arguments, more like clarifiers):

    Even the way homosexual is used frequently refers to male same sex attraction, which is ridiculous since homo literally means 'same'. Yet 'homo' on its own can even be a slur in mainstream society.

    Yes, there's probably no one perfect terminology to use, yes different terms are sometimes used interchangably, yet the mainstream usage still holds firmly in our current society. And even if 'gay' can refer to either gender same-sex the euphemism is still as strong.

    Just because someone may self-refer to being gay/lesbian (indicating acceptance of the term) does not detract from the point.

    In case it is unclear: this topic is suggesting there is probably some underlying, subtle 'homophobia' in our mainstream language (yes, by own argument 'homophobia' probably isn't a good term either).",2020-03-14 19:41:37,changemyview

CMV: We shouldn't get mad at corporations for being greedy.,"Businesses are created to make money, not friends. When a corporation has people who invest thousands, millions, or even billions of dollars as well as thousands of hours to grow the company, those investors are not looking for the company to use their return on investments to save the Koalas. People are risking time and money for these companies and are only looking for the best return on that risk. Corporations have no social obligation or duty to give back and to expect them to give away their legally obtained profits is greedy of us consumers.

This also applies to corporate taxes. To avoid paying huge sums of money through legal ways is a no brainer for a corporation. It is up to the government to fix the current tax system, not the company to just willingly give away 30% of it's profits just because Karen says ""It's the right thing to do!"".

I think they do so for at least 1 of these 3 reasons. 

1) STOCKHOLM SYNDROME. They too are targets of toxic masculinity and their experience is so traumatizing that denial is a means of survival. Taking out their anger on other victims makes them feel like they have some control over their own lives.  (E.g. secretly gay homophobic hate mongers)

2. JEALOUSY. They feel unattractive and invisible. They long for the male gaze and its “career perks”. When they see a more attractive woman who receives a lot of sexual/romantic attention (even unwanted), it makes them feel jealous and insecure. They think they can’t get by on their looks so they profess blind loyalty to sexual predators in hopes of it advancing their careers. 

3. CASTING COUCH GRADUATES. They have used sexual favors in exchange for career advancement because it’s easier than working hard.  They want to silence victims because if the predator is found guilty, they worry about the impact it will have on their career.",2020-03-14 17:47:33,changemyview

1. An example of what I think happens with this advice

2. Why I think this type of person that I'm describing in the example is *likely* the person reading the advice that is given online

3. Conclusion 


---------------------------


You see him keep glancing at you. His acne has been bleeding pretty badly for like this whole time and he smells like a sewer. He fucked up every part of the actual cooking class spectacularly and just kept bothering people with inane questions. 

The vibe he gives off is weird, at best. 

He comes over to you and says, with a breath smell that could kill a horse, in alternating volume that he obviously can't control ""HELLo I aM REdditor WAHT is YoUr name?"" 

You respond after collecting yourself from the ""what the fuck is going on here"" thoughts but take to long to respond and he starts yelling that people don't like him. It's probably scary at this point because the guy is obviously fucking unstable and could have  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN0CIQhbqNw](pepper spray). 

Mercifully someone comes over and asks him to leave, telling him that he's bothered enough people today, and then he sulks out, the air in the room becoming instantly breathable again. 

You have no idea what the fuck just happened and your day is, at least, a bit worse for it. 

What was the events leading up to this?

Well it's very possible that this guy asked online (could have even went to the IncelTears advice post https://www.reddit.com/r/IncelTears/comments/ffqcpg/weekly_advice_thread_03090315/)

 ""I'm a (age that's way too old to have never dated like 25 or something) year old guy and I want to meet women what do I do?"" 

And one of the helpful commentors respond ""Go to a cooking class my dude! You can't screw it up! It's a shared activity! It's not that bad! Learn to talk to people, practice your social skills!"" Without considering that the guy is probably pretty fucking weird.

And then he goes.

-------------------------------


""You're super exaggerating. This is dumb. Why would someone who asks for advice online behave like that?""

The average person who is in the subreddit /r/IncelTears in the advice thread, or actively posts ""how do I talk to women"" on the website Reddit.com is not your normal person on average. By far. 

You have to know what reddit is. A lot of normies do but every nerd does so it's more likely it's some 'normal' nerd. But to know /r/inceltears? Well you gotta be pretty deep into the internet and you're probably a ""weird nerd"". To go to the inceltears advice thread and ask for advice on how to get women cause you're 25 and can't hold a fucking conversation? You're weird enough that giving you advice would lead to the scenario above more often than not. 

I assume I'll have a lot of people arguing with me on this point but I feel like I spend enough time on the internet (how sad) to get the general 'type' of people that post.

----------------------------------------


So what can we draw from this? Well in our example, and it's just an example it could be hundreds of interactions that are equally awkward, we have

1. Someone who is very annoyed and/or scared about what the fuck just happened

2. Someone who is now more angry that people don't want to talk to him

3. A bunch of other people's whose days were just made significantly worse

So if we can conclude that the average person who posts in these threads would act like in the example then would we still give the advice to ""just go talk to people?""

I'd say very clearly not. Other people, and women specifically as it's usually about them on Reddit, are not objects you can attempt to train your social skills on. 

It's ridiculous to give the advice to ""just got practice on people"" and completely forgetting that the other people are actually, you know, people with thoughts and feelings who probably don't want to be bothered by the guy you're telling ""go get em tiger!"".

CMV: Paedophiles should have psychiatric help rather than imprisonment..or worse.,"This is gonna be a controversial one so please keep this discussion civil as you can and before I get into this, I do not condone any abuse towards children. Physical or otherwise. I would also like to make a clear distinction between a paedophile and child abuser. One carries out horrible acts on children (child abuser) and one has romantic/sexual feelings towards minors. 

Paedophiles are some of the most targeted people in society. No matter where you go, they are the most hated and vilified person that exists. Which is understandable as they naturally would target vulnerable children to be a part of their fantasies. 

Paedophiles are more often than not are struggling with serious mental issues which stem from abuse that they received when they were young. This doesn't excuse any actions taken by them, it simply gives explanation. If someone was the victim of any kind of abuse, they are very likely to perpetrate that same type of abuse to others. 

My idea for what could remedy this issue is beginning stronger research on how to help change their way of thinking. They obviously need serious psychiatric intervention.

What I fear is the issue with people having such fixed views which are to kill/imprison pedophiles (before they carry out abuse) is that it will drive people who are experiencing feelings towards children which are wrong, to never talk about it. This is when the problem manifests. 

What makes this worse is the continual sexualisation of young people in pop-culture. It blurs the boundaries of maturity and this is, I feel, a serious issue no one is talking about. 

To make it clear again, people who have abused children physically should have a consequence. Jail may be appropriate but there might be other things out there we don't consider to actually change these people from having such horrible fantasies. 

I will change my mind on this matter, if someone can give a good reason as to why someone doesn't deserve a chance at redemption. I get that there needs to be appropriate consequences for child abusers, but for someone in possession of media of children for example should be given psychological help. And some community service.

CMV: There’s no good reason to get married.,"Before we begin, I want to say that I’m not here to change anyone’s views. A lot of the posts here seem to be written as a CYV and not a CMV. This is a CMV. I’m here to see I can get a better understanding of the reasons to get married, because as it is, I just really don’t understand why it exists as an institution. I mean, I think it’s just a relic from a more archaic age, but I’m here to see if that’s mistaken. I’ve never been married, I’m no expert. So, let’s keep things nice and avoid angry or condescending talk. We’re wasting our free time on reddit, so let’s enjoy it :)

So, my thoughts on this are that if divorce exists, it totally undo’s the weight of any commitment associated with marriage. There is no salient difference between two people coupling up as a boyfriend/girlfriend and two people linking up as husband/wife (or wife/wife, etc). The only difference is that to end the relationship you have to get lawyers involved. This brings me to my next point: it makes no sense at all to me to involve the government in your private relationship. None whatsoever. I don’t know why it’s any of their business who I spend my time with. And that’s all I see marriage as: the choice to involve the state into your relationship. Why do people want this? 

There are clear benefits in certain cases, like lower taxes, help with visas, help with child adoption, but to most people those don’t matter at all when they choose to get married, because they do so for an ideological reason. There’s something appealing about the formal vow to stay together. Fine. But WHY does that formal vow have to be legally binding? Shouldn’t a private conversation with your lover where you both promise to work together to stay together just as ideologically pure (or more so) than signing a piece of paper and handing it to a government official? 

I guess my point is that the main reason to get married is an ideological one, and a simple promise fulfills that just fine, so why get legally married at all? 

It’s almost like these two people that are a couple, they make this promise to each other, but one or neither of them believe the other when they make the promise, so they make them carry out this demonstration of their love by taking legal measures. Isn’t this a sign of mistrust? Why isn’t the question of marriage seen in the same way that the question of a pre-nup is? Both are indicators that the two people don’t truly trust one another. 

I just don’t get it. To my eyes, marriage is just something that exists because of tradition, and people only still do it because they are worried that by taking a stance and saying that they don’t want to get married, the other person will not believe them and think, “no, he just doesn’t want to get married to *me*.” All of the reasons to get married seem to be based around *mistrust* instead of trust.

"CMV: Terminating a pregnancy is not the same thing as ending a life ie, abortion is not murder.","So my understanding of the pro life movement is that they believe life begins at conception, therefore all the legal protections of a person should begin at that point in time. Under this view, a baby, a fetus, an embryo, and a zygote should all be equal in the eyes of the law.

But does this make any sense? I say no for 2 major reasons.

The first reason revolves around how many fertilized eggs (or human beings if you are a pro-lifer) actually even make it to birth. [2/3 of all embryos fail to fully develop into a full term pregnancy.](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/10/101003205930.htm) This means that 66% of all lives end before they even begin. There will be more fetus souls in heaven than the souls of adults and children combined. This just seems absurd to me that God would create 66% of people just to throw them away immediately without even getting a chance to live. What would be the point of this?

The 2nd reason is that we know for a fact that the human body will miscarry for a number of reasons, too much stress, malnutrition, drug use, etc. Our body naturally knows for some situations that it just isn't a good time for a baby, and the body ABORTS it in response. With the advancement of medical technology why shouldn't we use our higher cognitive ability to make that same decision for bad situations our body can't understand? Like financial pressures, job/school obligations, or not wanting to be a parent (which tends to make for a bad parent by the way).

I'm sympathetic to prolife people, many believe they're trying to save 600,000 people that die each year from abortion, but this view is based on the absurd notion that life begins at conception, that a zygote is the same thing as a grown human being with relationships, feelings, thoughts and expression.",2020-03-14 09:31:22,changemyview

\- The [gender pay gap was massive](https://blogs.wsj.com/numbers/womens-pay-compared-to-mens-from-1960-to-2013-1774/) in the 60s, women earned 61 cents to the dollar compared to men and earned 78 cents to the dollar in 2013.

\- the average working week was 41.5 hours. It is now 34.5 hours. That's 7 hours a week people can spend with their loved ones that they couldn't before.

\- Providing the ""American Dream"" lifestyle for your family was only really possible if you were a white, (88%), able (down to 66%), straight (down to 62%), man (down to 31%) who graduated high school (down to just 12%!).

CMV: there is no moral defense for eating meat,"“In the popular mind the term ‘animals’ lumps together beings as different as oysters and chimpanzees while placing a gulf between chimpanzees and humans, although our relationship to those apes is much closer that the oysters” - Peter singer

The basis of the meat eaters argument is that human beings are in some way different or ‘special’ and somehow that gives us the right to kill and exploit animals.
This is the idea behind the ‘name the trait’ argument. 
What traits do nonhuman animals lack that if a human were to lack, we would treat the human the way we treat the animals? 
Common answers to this may be for example intelligence.
Sure animals have far less cognitive abilities than humans, but does that give us the right to eat them? If a human had less cognitive ability, would we be able to kill them?

Another part of the argument is the idea that none of these ‘traits’ can justify the killing of animals. Think about smell, sure dogs and wolves have a far better sense of smell than humans, does that give them the right to kill us?

Note. Some people may invoke religious ideas such as having a soul, I hope that won’t happen here as this sub is for rational and not faith based discourse. However, if you do see that as a justification, than do you think that believing ‘without evidence’ that someone or some group are somehow ‘inferior’ that it gives you the right to kill them, is it right to inflict your beliefs on anyone or anything that may not share your beliefs?

Now humans are certainly far more emotionally intelligent, we are far more complex in our fears, relationships, and empathy than other creatures. Sure this may mean that when weighing moral value, the human can be weighed higher than say a cow, but just because it would be worse to kill the human than the cow does not mean you should kill the cow. It’s worse to kill 100 people than it is to kill one, you still shouldn’t kill one.
Now you might ask where to draw the line, can I kill an ant? Can I chop down a tree?
And the answer comes from the idea of putting yourself in another’s shoes.

If you were in the position of a tree, would you be ok with being chopped down?
If you were a tree you wouldn’t know that you are being chopped down and thus that may make it justifiable to chop down trees.

Note. This is more of a guideline rather than a rule, if someone is in a coma it is still not ok to kill them even if they don’t know what is happening. A sense of self, while it is an important variable in determining moral value, is not the only variable to consider.

As far as the more practical reasons go if you need to eat meat for medical reasons go for it.

But if you are eating meat because it’s ‘more healthy’ then you have to consider whether or not your own slight improvement in health is worth the killing of an animal.
For example, eating meat can be beneficial for gaining muscle, but are those extra gains worth the life of animals?

Note. Eating meat is not always ‘more healthy’ and this argument is extremely nuanced

Just for context I am a meat eater who loves to eat meat, I have only recently come into the vegetarian/vegan argument so I would really like for someone to change my mind so that I can eat meat without feeling like a piece of crap.",2020-03-14 05:31:52,changemyview

CMV: Provokative clothing are objecifying women. Women to some degrees are objectifiying thmeslves.,"I believe that the reason why women dress sexy is partially in order to get looked at. Some women dress sexy because they want to use their sexuality in order to get ahead at their work.

I think that these acts promote objectification of women, and some women are intentionally doing so in order to take advantage of their sexuality.

Men don't dress provokatively, and I believe men attract others more through character.

Some could argue it is fashion, but where does the line stand when women broadcast themselves in a physical way? I could walk around naked and call that just being fashionable. I don't want to see half of women's breasts on the street. I don't want to SEE women's visible private parts, and some people may call me weird for that, but I think thats sexual assualt too. Men don't have half their dicks out to be confident of ourselves, and maybe it's just the way I am, but it grosses me out. And unless it is the body of the person I truly love, I don't want their breasts visible. Women shouldn't objectify themselves if they want to stand brighter in the society. They shouldn't feel like they need to, but our society has made them feel that way (which is ultimately due to men's behaviors) and I guess our society is fucked up in that way.

I often keep to myself, silently thinking about how pathetic that is and that they seriously need to get their crap together. As a result, they're very unreliable and unmotivated, which they have a medical excuse for and nearly nothing else they can do to pursue aid.

"CMV: there's nothing inherently wrong with being a ""simp"" and the term should die out soon","Ok, first off. I understand many people don't take this term as seriously because it's risen to fame in meme culture. Apparently it became a thing on tik tok, so I could basically just rest my case there. It seems the term itself is mocked and starting to become out of favor.  But I still had to say something.

There's nothing *inherently* wrong with complimenting a woman, being involved in circles and  etc. I just don't get it. Yes, de facto there are stereotypical creeps who do some ..obsessive things, with this idea of getting a girlfriend by being ridiculously subservient. Or people who insincere, just to gain respect and get in a relationship. 

But who the hell can spread the idea that it's always negative behavior? I may be a lonely young idiot, never dated anyone.... but isnt a sincere, flirty encounter a better way to get involved in a relationship? That's my baseline understanding; I've ended up having crushes on some people after being kinda friendly, getting to know them better.

And ""simping"" is supposedly associated with incels? Or that's just what many want to believe and generalize. Look I can definitely say **i'm not an incel.** I don't support *true* incels, which I consider to be misanthropic, straight men who are openly misogynistic and Sometimes I just feel that ""incel"" is used in a derogatory way without real concrete evidence of a certain person or whatever, having these hateful ideas that the would fit in with the edgelord/incel group. But with simp I just barely see how this could be used in a fair, non derogatory way, outside of memes and satire. Isn't it toxic masculinity/misogyny to chastise other males for just trying to empower a woman? Do most women, statistically i'm talking of course, really think this is creepy or pandering? And get this, what would guys think if the genders were switched??

"CMV: It is perfectly acceptable and healthy for a relatively normal, in shape, and successful guy in his early 30's to decide to give up on dating because it's ""the easy road"" and because he ""doesn't want to get hurt.""","Let me just start off this post by saying that I really do feel that I in no way fit into any kind of ""incel"" category. Throughout my entire adult life I have lived what many would consider a normal life. I have two degrees. I partied hard during my first one. I've experimented with drugs. I slept around
 I dated with my ok gest relationship lasting a year. Several of my friends have gotten married and I still hang out with them. I am financially stable. I have a solid career that will never get me rich but that will allow me to live a good middle of the road life that I am content with. Even in my early 30s I still find time to go to the gym and I have hobbies I enjoy. I am happy with myself.

However, one thing that has started happening over the past several years is that several family members (especially my mother) and a couple of friends have expressed concerns over the fact that I haven't dated or even tried dating anyone in well over 8 years. I do not have a problem with this issue. But everyone else seems to.

Bottom line is that I just feel I have a pragmatic and realistic view in life, and especially romantic endeavours and I do not feel the need or want to date for the sole reason that I just don't feel like opening myself up to disappointment like that. 

All my life I have learned that people around me just plain suck with regards to conscientiousness in many respects compared to me. I never make plans or commitments unless I know I can commit to them. I show up on time to work. I never bail last minute on plans. If I say I can do something for someone I fucking do it. I'm not saying this to pump my own tires. It's just true.

Starting with my own father who left my mother and little brother and I when j was younger I have just come to not expect anything out of people. People suck. They miss work. They come in late. They bail on plans last minute. They drop classes 2 weeks before projects are due without telling anyone. Dating it's even worse how. Ghosting is just standard operating procedure and people treat it like it's ok. Like, how much fucking work does it take to just write ""Hey, Im just not feeling this vive between us. But best of luck in finding what you're looking for."" Rather than just ignoring and not talking to someone out of the blue?!

Anyways, after a long struggle of a childhood, then a long struggle in my early 20s of getting a career going, I decided to take the easy road on one thing in my life: dating. I decided that I would just go celibate and not put up with any of it anymore because I just didn't want to. 

Dating in itself is just a weird and stupid process I think. Take normal friendships for instance. I have been friends with some people since I was in high school. Sure there have been times when we haven't talked as much as we wanted. Our interests were different, etc. But there has never been a friendship in my life that ended where it wasn't over a good reason. Sure I've drifted apart from some people but I was never close with them to begin with. 

But this isn't the case with dating at all. You just become close friends with someone. It could be for months and years. Then, one day, out of the blue, they can just sit you down randomly and tell you they don't want to be friends anymore for no good reason. Then all of a sudden they're just gone from your life. Sure there are relationships that end for a good reason like abuse and whatever. But for the most part relationships just end over far less than a platonic friendship would ever end over.

So all in all, after not having a single good memory from my childhood, years of sturggling after school to get in my feet and get a solid career going, I decided some years ago that I am entitled to taking the easy road on this. I have  struggled and had enough problems in my life. I finally have a life that I have built that I am proud of and I don't want to share it with anyone. I don't want to roll the dice on another person who could just turn out to be unreliable. I do that want to spend thousands of dollars of my hard earned money on a divorce. But most of all, I don't want to put in the emotional investment into a partnership with another person that's hard to get off the ground, and easy to lose. After a hard life I deserve to choose the easy road and there is nothing wrong with doing so.

CMV: 1984 Isn't That Good,"Most American high schoolers have had read 1984 at some point. I did, and maybe it's just me, but I was very disappointed by it in high school, and after rereading it my opinion hasn't changed much. 

Like a lot of people in high school, you start feeling more obligated to have political opinions and to begin learning about the political world. I was already a history fanatic, so I had some cursory knowledge and had been interested in political perspectives and the mechanics of state change, as much as a 16 year old can be at least. So, I was excited to start reading what was being sold to me as ""political literature"" (obviously not in the theory sense, but you know). 

""This may be relevant in your lifetime"", ""This is a realistic prediction of a modern dictatorship"", ""From this book you'll learn about the mechanics of dictatorship/totalitarianism and know how to identify it"" etc etc.

That was the perspective I had going in, and most people still do by the way I hear Orwell talked about. But, I remember just reading the first chapter after first getting my copy in class and thinking ""well that's a little on-the-nose."" This was generally the way I felt whenever it came to the book and how it created the concept of INCSOC and Oceania. In the end, I came away not really feeling like I learned about the nuances of totalitarian rule or how dictators can get power or how societies collapse, instead, it seemed to me like the MOST stereotypical and cheesy dystopian story in a world of revitalized cheesy dystopia stories, which was super disappointing. 

I still have some friends from marching band who were freshmen while I was graduating, they're reading it now and we started talking about it the other day. I borrowed his book and I've been going through it a bit in the last few days (I haven't finished nor can I say I've been that invested in it, for reasons I'm about to get to). I was curious if maybe I just missed something, or didn't have enough experience to understand it, or something else, so I was hoping to get something new out of it. So far, nothing. 

What I think the problem is is that the way it's sold to us as teenagers, and even as adults, is as a guide to identifying and combating fascism and totalitarianism. Except, this book takes place in a world so far thrown into this dystopia that the mechanics of how it got there are lost to the deus ex machina of ""Nuclear War"". 

To get from, for example, a 1930's Imperial Britian, sure a currupt and not exactly PC place but not hell on earth, to a 1984 INCSOC, requires so many things to happen, and it feels like the book is being presented to us in a way that is supposed to be about that change and those mechanics, but it's not. Winston simply finds himself in a pre- and post-nuclear war world, where his country went in the constitutional monarchy/deomocracy (or whatever happy/smiley political ideology that got rekked by INCSOC was) and came out a totalitarian dictatorship. Poof, democracy (or whatever) gone.

If one of the mission statements of reading 1984 is ""to understand how totalitarianism controls people and takes over society"", which in my case it was, as with my friends in school now, how are you supposed to get that out of this deus machina? And, if the transition from what is inferred to be the real world to 1984 is one that involves no realistic or predicable line of logic, why should I take the world of INCSOC as anything to base my belief of what a real world dictatorship might look like? 

It's much closer to fallout than, for (a radical but still more realistic and reasonable than \*poof nuclear war changed the fundamentals of your society\*) example, Hilary Clinton becomes Biden's VP, uses him to win election, then accuses him of being mentally unfit for office, thus essentially usurping the Presidential desk (I am not trying to make any sort of statement with this example, just trying to think about what a modern-day coup/overthrow/whatever-you-get-it might manifest as). That would make people very upset, and would certainly draw real world complaints of ""rigging/gaming the system, corruption, wrongly taking office without being voted in = authoritarianism, etc"". Yet, even in this silly example with Empress Hillary, she's still beholden to constitutional law and the will of the people who could, and maybe would, physically rebel, not to mention European intervention in obviously dirty politics, she would be many, many steps away from creating some sort of INCSOC. I think it would still be pretty hard to establish an INSOC-like state even during the post-nuclear war example Orwell uses, as just because a lot of people are dead and theres not as much stuff, doesn't mean people will just submit themselves to being sheep for the rest of their lives. People need to be pandered to to get them on your side in the first place, just cause there's been a nuclear holocaust doesn't mean the remaining people will simply give up and bow down to a party that undoubtedly, in every single possible way, treats them like complete and utter shit. And you're telling me after Australia, the Americas, and Britain combine into one political entity that there is only ONE political party with any resemblance of power?

It's an obviously absurd and laughable hunger-games premise when picked apart, but this is supposed to be one of the greatest political narratives of our time, it should be picked apart, and I feel it should be taken seriously that what many people use as their real world translation for what a totalitarian state would look like is not something they could ever realistically experience. I've yet to here from friends and teachers why 1984 is any more insightful into what a totalitarian regime is like than essentially any other dystopia, documentary, or whatever, hence why I'm here

Beyond the premise, most of the awful horrible things that happen to everyone all the time are all pretty well known by every body in the story and pretty on-the-nose (the Ministry name irony is really some of the laziest and most unimpressive stuff I've ever seen regarded as genius writing in my life). These are things that make sense to have going on when you have an omnipotent government who can endlessly fight wars against literally more than half the planet forever while also keeping literally everyone within the state under check, but like, obviously. They don't make sense to have going on in a society that's only 50 years separated from a fairly free and happy society, much less, during the transition from that destroyed, but still happy memory of a society, to this literal hell on earth. You have to assume the average people, who make up 85% of the population according to the book, really just sat there and took it all from the start or just really never caught on. This is another unrealistic assumption that is necessary for INCSOC to exist, and it further weakens the relatablility and relevance of the story to the real world.

I have a feeling many of the comments will be something along the lines of ""well you're really caught up on the book needing to make the transition between societies realistic. The book is mostly about already living in a Totalitarian society, it's past that point."" And I get that. But if that's the case, isn't it just a dystopian love adventure story? The only real way the book can narritively connect itself to the real world is through that transition, which the point I'm making is that it doesn't. Why are we teaching this to kids at school if it's just about living in a semi-fantasy dystopia?

Because that's what this is really about, how is 1984 one of the premier books to understanding the mechanics of of totalitarianism? The premise of the totalitarian regime in the book is silly, the policies that define it are unacceptable and to believe that nuclear war erases the need for compromise between state and citizen is wrong, it completely disregards the need for pretty-politics and satisfying it's people and constituents, and assumes an unending and incorruptible power base. Why should it be taken seriously if it disregards the complex nuances that defines ACTUAL modern day corruption/authoritarianism/totalitarianism 

Just adding in last minute: (It doesn't really even do historical authoritarianism justice. I'm pretty sure the obvious metaphor is Nuclear War : WWI as INCSOC : NAZIs, but I mean, it's still a pretty weak comparison. It just dismisses the people's participation in the Nazis, rascism, hitler's political games and gang control, appeasement, other wars, the long history of European foreign politics. Claiming the shift from normal britian to INCSOC just being nuclear war is a satisfactory explanation for the power dynamics/history/relevancy to the real world is kind of like saying just knowing about WWI's exisiance explains Hitler's rise to power. I think any sane person would say the more relevant factors of Hitler's getting power had to do much more with the intricacies of the politics in germany, his own personal corruption efforts, and his ability to gain support via hate. There aren't really translations for those actually important variables in 1984, which is what makes the political metaphor weaker again and makes the world lack substance.)

CMV: Leftists and left leaning people should not vote blue no matter who,"Speaking as a leftist here. A real one, socialist, guns, ACAB etc. not the ""leftist"" that some right wing people call liberals.

We should absolutely not vote for Biden in November against Trump. The election was rigged from the start.

First with the constant attacks on Bernie on the news 24/7 and clear tampering with data in a way that technically truthful though meant to mislead the public. Examples on r/BernieBlackout the boomers that watch them that may have voted for him if he was covered fairly like any other candidate now think he's scum of the earth and has no chance of beating trump.

Secondly the drop outs and endorsements so very clear pressure from candidates that otherwise hated Biden. Like Kamala was expected so was Bloomberg's though Buttiegeg and Biden had literally in the past said Biden was a step backwards and that he would t be what's best for the country then they endorse him? Christ Buttiegeg with Medicare for All Who Want It was copying and tweaking Bernie's plan now he endorses for the one who would leave millions uninsured? That doesn't make sense.

Plus Warren's delayed and possibly no endorsement of Bernie who she is very clearly the closest in policy to doesn't make sense without some sort of pressure from the DNC.

Not to mention letting someone buy his way into the election.

They have been shaming Bernie and his supporters for 4 years treating us like the reason Trump won. They think that no matter what they do they'll secure our vote and they don't deserve it. They have to realize that they need to earn our vote and corruption in the DNC isn't any better than the corruption in the White House right now.

How I see it is Trump would be a better choice in 2020 for progressives. If he's elected it's more likely that a democrat will be elected in 2024 and the chances of that democrat being a progressive are a lot higher than if Biden were to run for re election likely unopposed in 2024. If Biden wins we get possibly 8 years of his conservatism lite then probably another version of Trump for another possible 8 years.

So that might just be 16 years of conservatism where people are sick and dying without healthcare. People are getting evicted and sent out on the streets and the poor are barely scrapping by. A lot of people will die in those 16 years.

Though if Trump is elected and a progressive wins than that's only 4 years of death. It sucks though if Bernie doesn't get the nomination or Biden doesn't suddenly support M4A that's just what's gonna happen. Plus the policy implemented by that progressive like M4A likely won't be repealed just like the ACA hasn't been repealed. Or other protections for people like Minimum wage or worker safety weren't repealed. Especially since the program is so popular. So even if we get Trump 2 after the progressive, lives would still be saved.

Didn't even mention how 4 years of Trump avoiding global warming is much preferable to 8 - 16 years of the US avoiding it. Especially at the 16 year point we'd have run out of time by then.

Similarly, if you want censorship of x ideology, it means you don't really think your ideology is strong enough to attack them without the help of force.

If you get used to ""winning"" against nazis/socialists/whatever with censorship then it means that a dictator will have no problem coming your way and convincing you that lynching whatever minority comes in the way, be it Jews, blacks, whites, muslims, uyghurs etc. is the right way to go.

This is a critique of both hate speech laws and the censorship of fascism which is currently in place in some European countries, I am not a fascist and strongly believe in free speech and debate.

CMV: Libraries are obsolete.,"Libraries are obsolete.

Yes, libraries may be a place to have fun, meet people, etc, but there’s no need for them in today’s society in the age of technology. You can order and rent books online. You can even download some books for free. The fact that the US government spends 1.3 billion dollars on libraries is ridiculous. The government should only be spending money on things people need, not forms of entertainment for people. Our government doesn’t exist for that. 

And no one seems to care! Conservatives go on and on about how our government needs to stop spending millions and billions of dollars on things “we don’t need”, but they don’t care if the government spends over a billion dollars on libraries. They get upset if our government assists poor people in need, but seem be ok if the government spends over a billion dollars on libraries. WTF is this logic? 

Libraries were useful before the age of technology but they are obsolete today. Our government shouldn’t be spending any kind of money on anything that’s obsolete. The government shouldn’t be spending over a billion dollars on something that’s basically just a form of entertainment these days.",2020-03-12 21:27:53,changemyview

CMV: Manning should have been released months ago.,"Chelsea Manning just [tried to end her life](https://edition.cnn.com/2020/03/12/politics/chelsea-manning-suicide-attempt-virginia-jail/index.html). 

If you’re wondering why she’s imprisoned, it’s because she’s been held in contempt of court since March 8 last year. She could have freed herself at any point. She could have avoided accruing fines of $230,000 and counting ($1000 per day). But she refuses to testify before the federal grand jury investigating Assange and WikiLeaks.

Her current imprisonment is widely recognized [as tantamount to torture](https://theintercept.com/2020/01/02/chelsea-manning-torture-prison-united-nations/). Which is nothing new in the relationship between Manning and the US government. She was [severely mistreated](https://www.salon.com/2010/12/15/manning_3/) under the Obama administration - though [he didn’t see it that way](https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/12/us/12manning.html). The British government (Manning holds dual citizenship) [was pretty concerned](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2011/04/brits_pressure_us_on_bradley_m.html) though and ultimately even a military judge [recognized the undeniable](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jan/09/bradley-manning-wikileaks-mistreated-progressives).

The idea behind Manning’s detention this time (if you grant that it’s not about punishment and retribution by the government - which is debatable I think) is that it will compel compliance with the grand jury. This means it is not punishment for non-compliance - which would be grossly unconstitutional in any case. 

This justification falls away the moment it is recognized (by a judge) that the prisoner won’t be compelled by it. Therefore, grand jury resistance [is a thing.](https://www.salon.com/2014/02/03/the_strange_success_of_grand_jury_resistance/) - in this case after 241 days for example.",2020-03-12 19:24:44,changemyview

"CMV. Trumps not a good president (In my opinion), but Hillary would have probably been way worse.","
Don’t get me wrong. As it says in the title, I don’t like Trump either. Let me prove it! Trump killing Soleimani was a bad idea. Escalating things with Iran was dumb, because going to war with Iran is something that no one wants to do, especially if other countries in the Middle East get on Iran’s side. Trump ignored the Coronavirus until it was such a big deal, Italy had shut its whole country down because of it, essentially forcing him to talk about it. Trump basically didn’t even try to work hard to get into a political position, and just got his dad to help him get to the position he’s in today, and Trump made a bad immigration policy.

Now, all that’s bad, but Hillary Clinton also had some problems that makes her a bad pick for being a president. Let me list them and try and counter as many arguments I can before they’re in the comments.

1. Hillary Clinton wants a no fly zone over Syria:
—If the people reading this don’t know what a no fly zone is, a no fly zone is an area where planes and aircraft don’t have permission to fly. Putting a no fly zone over Syria will kill soldiers in the Middle East, American and Syrian, Russia will be pissed at the U.S, other countries in the Middle East will be affected, so more countries will get involved, and it would destroy the E.Us relationship with the U.S, because it would go against the E.Us ideals. So, in other words, World War 3 in 2016.

2. Hillary isn’t consistent with her statements:
—Let me list off some of the things Hillary has changed her mind on.

Hillary has changed her mind on...

-Gay Marriage (Before: No - After: Yes)

-Universal Healthcare (Before: Yes - After: No)

-No Child Left Behind (Before: No - After: Yes)

And every time Hillary gets called out for it, she says “New information came to light” or something of the sorts. But what new info was brought to light on Gay Marriage?

3. She’s fake as fuck:
—When Hillary was in the South of the U.S, she put on a fake southern accent, so the south could like her more. Whenever someone is making a good point, she smiles, as to give a “I know what I’m doing, so I’m worth voting for” feeling, and she lies all the time, to the public. She said implementing in no fly zone over Syria would save countless lives, then in a private interview, she said it would kill tons of Syrians, and she lied about confidential emails by saying she “accidentally” deleted all of them, and that the files directed her to delete them.

TL:DR, Trumps pretty bad, but Hillary lied about deleting confidential files, and saving Syrian lives. She’s inconsistent in her debates. Almost started something big with Russia in 2016 that would have killed tons of people, and acts differently depending on where she is in the U.S.A, to win the election.

So please, change my mind. I’m open to changing it.",2020-03-12 18:41:09,changemyview

"CMV: Being concerned about your native culture being erased, reduced, or drastically altered by an influx of people who do not share your culture is a valid concern.","Generally speaking whenever I see someone voice this point about immigration to a typically white, western nation it is dismissed as at best an irrational fear and at worst as a white nationalist talking point, but I think it's a valid concern and certain not one that one needs to be a racist or supremacist to hold. 

I've also noticed a bit of a double standard. 

For example, if a white French person were to voice concerns over how a large influx of Muslim immigrants was detrimental to French culture they would likely be dismissed as either just irrational or, possibly, a bigot. 

But if a Native American or native Hawaiian (for to US specific examples) were to voice concerns over how a large influx of white people was having a detrimental effect on their native culture that would be seen as a serious issue and the culture as something to protect and foster. 

On a semi-related topic as someone who lives in the SF Bay Area I've also noticed a bit of a double standard with gentrification. If a white person from San Jose or Palo Alto complains about how a large influx of wealthy Asian immigrants is pricing them out of areas that they've lived in for decades or generations they'll likely be seen as racist; if black and Hispanic people in Oakland complain about how an influx of white people is pricing them out of areas they've lived in for decades or generations that's seen as a valid concern and the influx as something to be combated. 

So what's up? Are all cultures something that should be preserved or just some of them? Is all gentrification bad or just the predominantly white kind?",2020-03-12 17:58:58,changemyview

CMV: A single global time would make more sense than 24 different time zones,"Imagine a 24 hour time system that remains the same across the globe. This means that “12 A.M.” in New York is also “12 A.M.” in China. Obviously one of these locations would be light out and the other would be dark. This time system would result in the end of one global “day” being light for half the world and dark for the other half. However, the distinction between days is already arbitrary depending on where you live, and this new system would be no worse than having a prime meridian which separates two different “days”. 

And honestly, who really cares if it’s light or dark during any given time. The fact that A.M. corresponds to day time is arbitrary anyways. We know that above the Arctic Circle or below the Antarctic Circle there is either sun or darkness for half the year, so there are already places on Earth where the light of day does not correspond to A.M. and P.M.

The other flaw of our current system is that at each of the time zone borders people lose and gain an hour of time. I’m sure many people have experienced this, but this means someone who has an hour commute across a time zone and has to get to get there for 8 A.M. now has to wake up an hour early to get there on time. A global time would eliminate these clunky borders. 

Instead, each location on Earth would know their mid day (aka noon) time relative to the global time. For example, if we keep London as the mean time for the new global time system, their mid day time would be 12:00. Accordingly, New York would have mid day of 16:00 as their relative daylight is shifted 4 hours.

Don’t overthink this switch. People will still work the same shifts as always. The only thing that would change is that instead of working “8:00 to 17:00”, the equivalent in New York would now be shifted 4 hours, so “12:00 to 21:00”. This would not change anything other than the unit of time. You would still work the same block of time, during the same daylight as hours as you always have. All that would be required is to adjust to your new position in the global time system.

As an example, let’s say you want to communicate with someone who lives the equivalent of one time zone away. You still know that their business hours are skewed one hour from yours, but now instead of it being 9 am where you are and 8 am where they are, it’s 9 am everywhere. You still have to remember that the person got to work an hour after you did and will stay there an hour later. Likewise, that person has to know you’re gonna leave an hour before them. This will occur no matter what time system we use. The difference with the global time system is that it eliminates the sudden jumps at arbitrary zoning lines on Earth.

The fact remains that no matter where you contact someone on Earth, you will have to be aware that their time of day could be different from yours and that their business hours will adjust accordingly. This is unavoidable due to the rotation of Earth. But from what I can tell, there are no downsides to switching to a global time system, only positives. 

The inherent assumption though is that the world has the technological capability to implement such a system. There will of course be growing pains as this transition is made, but it will only be temporary. It may take a transitionary period for everyone to adjust which could include the existence of local and global time for a short period before switching over to global time entirely.",2020-03-12 17:32:10,changemyview
CMV: The (USA) Republican Party Does Not Have a Consistent Ideology,"Full disclosure: I am left wing and the furthest right opinion I have heard from someone I knew personally in the last year was that Bloomberg would make a good president. Because of that I spend a lot of time reading right-wing magazines I find in doctor's office, reading articles and comments from Fox News whenever I look up a story, reading Goldwater, looking up videos from black conservatives, etc. I also used to be a Ron Paul supporter when I was in high school, and I was super into the libertarian ideology. I read all of Atlas Shrugged; took an online course with Learn Liberty; followed Thomas Sowell, Milton Friedman, Hayek, Walter E. Williams, Derrick Grayson, etc; pissed off my teachers; the works. Basically my point is that although I'm very much in an ideological bubble I also feel like I have a pretty good understanding of right wing viewpoints.

I try to think about what the parties would turn into in a parliamentary system. I feel like the Democrats are at most two parties: the Jeremy Corbyn socialist side and the Angela Merkel liberal side. Both of these factions have a pretty similar ideology: make sure that everyone is taken care of. Joe Biden thinks that Obamacare should be expanded and Bernie Sanders thinks we need to implement universal healthcare right now but both of them agree that health care should be available to everyone. It makes sense to me that they're both in the same party.

Contrastively, I feel like the Republican Party is basically a coalition of a ton of separate, sometimes conflicting ideologies. There are the libertarians, the evangelicals, the fiscal conservatives, the moral conservatives, the war hawks, white nationalists, anarcho-capitalists, the list goes on. I can't really see how George HW Bush, Donald Trump, Ron Paul, and Richard Nixon are all supposed to belong to the same party. 

I can't think of a one sentence summary for the Republican Party. If it's about freedom, how come it's also the party that opposes civil liberties and led the war on drugs? If it's about tradition, how can they support Donald Trump, oppose environmentalism, and expand the role of the American empire overseas? If it's about limited government and financial responsibility, how can they support cutting taxes, spending more and more on the military, creating the massive national security apparatus, and propping up big business with bailouts and right to work laws? If it's about physical safety, why do they support gun rights? 

I guess it weirds me out that the Republicans seem to have much more solidarity than the Democrats do when by my account the party is really just a marriage of convenience for a large number of factions which would otherwise oppose each other. Am I wrong, is there a comprehensive Republican ideology that unites all of these groups?",2020-03-12 17:30:22,changemyview
"CMV: If slaughterhouses had glass walls, (almost) everyone would be a vegetarian.","Paul McCartney once used this quote that ""if slaughterhouses had glass walls, everyone would be a vegetarian"". i feel that while it's true that it would turn a lot of folks into vegetarians but not all. I say this because there are folks out there who deliberately hit animals trying to cross a road and at times feast on the dead. on the other end of the globe we have humans who believe that if they torture a dog, it'll taste better. 

so apart from these sub humans who do unfortunately form a sizable population, i feel that others can be reasoned with. a lot of people have cognitive dissonance and believe that meat comes in a refrigerated package. i was one such guy and when i tried getting rid of this dissonance, i turned vegan. 

i believe that every school should conduct a bi monthly trip to slaughterhouses and then let kids decide if they wanna eat pigs/chickens/fill in the animal. i've also heard arguments like ""hey, even lions hunt and kill so it's natural"" to which i say...well, clothes are pretty unnatural and since you're such a natural person why not give up clothes. a lion hunts because they have no choice, you...a human living in a society that has combined wisdom of great civilisations obviously do.

it simply boils down to this in my view, people eat meat because of the taste (unless you're an Eskimo coz then it obviously makes sense to hunt) and everything else is just an excuse to support it. if it's mandatory for people to visit slaughterhouses, i believe that most people will give up meat.",2020-03-12 17:18:17,changemyview
"CMV: Calling COVID-19 ""Chinese coronavirus"" is unnecessary and fueling racism even if unintentional","First of all, as many people are probably aware, there have been a number of verbal and physical attacks on people of East Asian background all around the world stemming from fears about coronavirus, as well as their businesses suffering from unorganized boycotts and mocking of the deaths of people in China and elsewhere in Asia on social media. 

As to the name. Both the disease and the virus have official names according to the WHO.  [https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance/naming-the-coronavirus-disease-(covid-2019)-and-the-virus-that-causes-it](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance/naming-the-coronavirus-disease-(covid-2019)-and-the-virus-that-causes-it)  

It was initially named 2019-nCoV before having its name changed to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).  [https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30419-0/fulltext](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30419-0/fulltext)

There is not really a valid reason to give this virus a name that associates it with Wuhan or China. As noted above, it already had both a common and clinical name before anyone started calling it the Wuhan Virus or Chinese Coronavirus. There is no need for any clarification on which disease anyone is referring to when these terms are used. There's been some discussion recently around how past diseases have been named after regions they were first identified in/originated from. Examples include Marburg, Spanish Flu, Ebola, etc. In all of these cases, however, the geographic name was the disease's initial name. Since this has a name, there's no need to do this.

Attempts to rename coronavirus/COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 are pretty clearly agenda-driven. When Kevin McCarthy tweeted about ""Chinese coronavirus"" he wasn't doing that because he was concerned that Americans would confuse it with some other strain of coronavirus. I've seen arguments that it's an attempt to associate the disease with China and the Chinese government's failure to maintain hygiene and contain its spread. This may be a valid criticism of China but people of East Asian descent worldwide are the ones paying the price for these criticism not China. This also reeks of a grand tradition on social media, of which Reddit is a prime mover, of forming pitchfork parties before the whole story is known.

CMV: People are overreacting about Covid-19.,"Point 1: Covid-19 has killed approximately 5,000 people at the moment. On average 56,000 people die from the flu. On average 1.25 million people die from car crashes. Yet, the Coronavirus is what we are all worked up about right now. 

Point 2: The alleged mortality rate of Covid-19 is 3-4%. However, Covid-19 tests are not widespread or always accurate. This means that people with the disease are being overlooked which would make the denominator of the mortality rate higher thus making the mortality rate lower. Secondly the people that are being tested are people with severe symptoms which already puts them at a higher chance of dying from it whereas the people that are being overlooked are the ones that are less likely to die from it.

Counter Argument: “How are you going to say that Covid is no big deal when countries are literally shutting down because of it?” Firstly, just because countries are shutting down does not make it inherently dangerous. It just means that people perceive it as dangerous. Secondly, I understand there are real economic impacts of the coronavirus (just check the stock market), but that still does not mean that the virus itself is a threat to humans.

Given the flurry of recent announcements about COVID-19 and the measures taken to avoid large crowds, (NBA season suspended, March Madness without fans, etc.) I'm afraid going to this concert will infect my wife and I, which would be unacceptable.

**Satan**

Satan on the other hand is depicted using very masculine traits. To wit:

- Seduces Eve in garden of Eden
- Entices people to reject God and think critically (Gives Eve the fruit of the tree of knowledge)
- Trickster
- Jailer of Bad Souls (prison warden/guard?)
- Chaotic
- Adversarial
-  Inferior to God

God won the war against Satan and so God wrote the bible depicting herself in glowing terms generally, yet disowning her atrocities (e.g. drowning every living thing, except Noah et al,  in a fit of rage) by calling her a him.

CMV: Our democratic systems are not able to give the necessary answers to urgent ecological questions,"# Reasoning

Serious environmental protection means severe restriction of individual freedom. A majority of the people will not vote for a restrictive policy where the superfecial effect brings only negative impact to their lives. The major environmental problems themselves are too abstract to be captured precisely by the voters.

While I see that ecological crisis like climate change and the loss of biodiversity are getting more attention in the recent years, answers given by politics mostly tackle the technical side of the problem but never aim to achieve a real change in the behaviour of the population. The reason therefor is:

* It will lead to the loss of votes
* Politics and business are far too closely intertwined (not the subject I want to discuss here)

The biggest part of environmental protection is reducing consumption and therefore a non-growth (or even negative-growth) economy. This has many implications and brings A LOT of negative effects to people (voters) in the first world. Our current standard of living is higher than we can maintain.

I don't see how a democratic system can give necessary answers that ""hurt"" the voters.

# Example

Meat and other animal products

The science is pretty clear on this one:

&gt; Efforts to curb greenhouse-gas emissions and the impacts of global warming will fall significantly short without drastic changes in global land use, agriculture and human diets, leading researchers warn in a high-level report commissioned by the United Nations.
&gt; The special report on climate change and land by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) describes plant-based diets as a major opportunity for mitigating and adapting to climate change ― and includes a policy recommendation to reduce meat consumption

[IPCC Report](https://www.ipcc.ch/srccl/)

&gt; The consumption of animal-sourced food products by humans is one of the most powerful negative forces affecting the conservation of terrestrial ecosystems and biological diversity. Livestock production is the single largest driver of habitat loss [...] in developing tropical countries.

[Machovina et al.](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2015.07.022)

From a logicial point of view it's easy. We have to reduce our consumption of such products to a minimum or if possible even stop completly. But meat is a highly emotional (and economic) subject. In our democratic systems it's impossible to give a fast and sufficient anwser to such questions.

# Proposal

In my opinion some kind of world government could be a solution. It would have to be based primarily on scientific knowledge and only secondarily on the will of the people. At this level goals would be set which all subordinate governments would have to comply with.

CMV: America should not be blamed for Coronavirus,"First of all, I am not saying that America is the best when it comes to handling certain situations. I think they can do a lot better, but at least they’re trying to do something.

Say what you want about Trump, but at least he did a few things. He banned air travel from select countries. As controversial as it is, nobody wants to be infected at all.

Blaming the US is not very productive and rational reasoning at all. It only promotes division and anxiety. 

I am also sick of hearing about all of the negative news stories from the media on how we are all going to die. Why not talk about positive stories. Why not talk about Taiwan and Singapore containing the virus very fast. Not many countries in the world do it.

Speaking of countries, I believe that the only country truly responsible for the outbreak is China. I’m not blaming the citizens at all. I’m blaming the media there and the media all over the world. The media in China wanted to censor the whole thing for the first few months of the outbreak. Did they seriously not think about how bad this outbreak could be or are they desperately censoring and oppressing society?

Also regarding the media is a subreddit called r/Coronavirus. They love spreading fear and the users there are extremely vile and toxic. If you disagree on a quarantine or a blame game, you will be attacked. One guy even wished for Trump to be assassinated. This is not 1963 folks.

Bottom line, we shouldn’t blame America and hate on the United States for this outbreak, despite the fact that there’s always room for improvement. I would blame the Chinese media, the media in general, and the extremely toxic users in r/Coronavirus.

"CMV: thinking “CoVID-19 doesn’t affect me since I’m not elderly or an at risk group” is like thinking “driving on the sidewalk in a car is okay, since you’re at a low risk of being hurt if you do hit something”.","Herd immunity is a thing. When vaccines aren’t an option I think there’s a social responsibility of the ‘not at risk’ group to be vigilant in not spreading shit to at risk group. 

Similarly to not smoking around pregnant women or people in general.. just because you’re okay to take that risk to go party in Asia and come back and go back to work, doesn’t mean the rest of us at work want to take that risk.

Recently there’s been a large amount of communities and anecdotes that make me cringe. Many of them revolve around the same ‘oh I’ll be fine since I’m young, or the risk is low, etc etc’ 

In the same way that people who don’t vaccinate don’t realize that herd immunity benefits those who aren’t able to be immunized, staying safe and practicing healthy and mitigating risk protects the spread of the disease. 

COVID-19 has a fairly long incubation and healthy individuals can pass the virus onto others without and before exhibiting symptoms, even more so some individuals may not even exhibit obvious or realize they’ve contracted the virus and pass it onto others.

This is fine and all, but then there’s the amount of ‘self-imposed isolation policy’ as the measure to contain. It only takes a handful of people underestimating the risk they pose after a trip or exposure to  creating a chain of spread. 

I get that people have to work to support themselves probably make necessary trips. 

This is more directed at the individuals who can’t bear to cancel their delightful spring break plans to a hot destination, and can afford to self quarantine and just straight up won’t. 

It only takes a handful of people thinking : “I’d rather not miss out on 2 weeks pay check despite being capable of affording to” to counteract that amount of containment and diligence the rest of us are trying to adhere to.",2020-03-12 10:08:45,changemyview
CMV: I don’t think student loan debt should be forgiven,"
Why should someone be saved from a debt that they willingly incurred? It makes no sense at all to me. Perhaps the predatory loans or interest rates should be regulated or perhaps paused but to just forgive them outright is crazy. You chose which school you went to and you should have read the terms before signing on the line, no one forced you to do any of that. There are plenty of community colleges or technical schools that you could have chosen to go to but because of pride or a lack of foresight you did not. Should a person who becomes a carpenter and purchases a truck for work be forgiven their car loan or have their tools purchased for them? I don’t see anyone arguing that. Biden (I’m not a supporter but I just learned of this) has a plan that civil servants be given some debt relief and that makes some sense to me because they are giving back to the community but why should someone who takes out a bunch of loans to go try and make a bunch of money in the private sector be given anything at all? You set out to line your own pockets and you want my tax dollars to help you? F that. I’m sorry you may be under crushing debt but you did it to yourself and the amount of entitlement involved in the idea of total forgiveness makes me kinda angry.

Common examples

these are sighs of affection: https://www.insider.com/cat-signs-of-affection-2018-8

I want to point out the one i consider the most important one, number 5. Your cat literally feeds you! (of course you mightn't consider it food but the cat has no way of knowing that since to it it's delicious.)

I know, there are much more examples of dogs, but i want you to consider these 3 things: 
1. Dogs are way stronger and bigger than cats, because of that they are way more capable of saving a life. 
2. Dogs are literally trained for generations to protect, while cats are as nature left them, They instinctively attack nothing larger or as large as themselves.(yes they are more domestic now, but nobody (except maybe psychoes) forces them to do anything, let alone protect.
3. Even if dogs weren't domesticated they still live in packs (as wolves), where it's natural To attack something large, whereas cats do everything alone.

CMV: Slowing the coronavirus spread will require measures that will destroy the economy,"We've currently reached a stage of the COVID-19 virus where governments are talking about mitigating the damage rather than stopping the epidemic in it's tracks. In particular, there's currently a lot of news articles about ""[flattening the curve](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/11/science/coronavirus-curve-mitigation-infection.html)"" of the epidemic:

&gt; The ideal goal in fighting an epidemic or pandemic is to completely halt the spread. But merely slowing it — mitigation — is critical. This reduces the number of cases that are active at any given time, which in turn gives doctors, hospitals, police, schools and vaccine-manufacturers time to prepare and respond, without becoming overwhelmed. Most hospitals can function with 10 percent reduction in staff, but not with half their people out at once.

But what these articles always lack is a calculation of how much time it will take to fight the virus. Let's take some current statistics about the US and COVID-19.

Total number of hospital beds: 900k

Total number of vacant beds: 35% or 315k. Let's be generous and increase that number to 500k, presuming that more hospitals could be quickly built like in Wuhan.

% hospitalized for COVID-19: 5% as a low-ball estimate

Median hospital stay: 2 weeks

Now let's plug-in all the numbers. If we have 500k beds at our disposal, it means that 500k * (1/0.05) = 10m patients can be sick at any given time.

If we have 10m patients at the same time, it means that it would take 350m/10m = 35 batches of patients for the entire US population to become immunized through viral exposure.

And finally, since it takes 2 weeks for the hospital backlog to clear, it will take 35 * 2 = 70 weeks for the disease to run it's course. That's 70 weeks of significant restrictions. 70 weeks of limited bars, pubs and restaurants. 70 weeks of reduced travel. 70 weeks of low business for hotels. 70 weeks of no sports games. This would bankrupt such a large section of the economy that it will take many years for the country to recover.

I therefore believe that the currently proposed scenario of ""flattening the curve"" will be suicidal for the economy. CMV.",2020-03-12 06:22:37,changemyview

They are 100% correct.

Being able to make it to the level of any professional male sport requires you to be among the best humans in the sport.

Where as being a professional women in women sport just requires you to be among the top woman in the sport. 

There are men who have no chance at making it professionally but they could easily overtake the best of women.

Women are lucky to have leagues that are segregated just for them. Otherwise they wouldn’t be represented in sports.

CMV: Income inequality doesn't matter.,"From my understanding the actual income inequality around the world has not changed very much in the last few centuries so you will first need to prove that point. As the title says I don't believe income inequality should matter to anyone. My three main reasons are below but there is a TL;DR at the bottom.

First, changes in economic inequality have been shown to have little to no impact on other parts of the economy. It has no relation to other economic figures which I believe are obviously important such as unemployment, inflation, growth, and stability. The only issues which income inequality seem to have an impact on have to do with social unrest and government trust.

Second, it is easily proven that being statistically poorer than others on one graph does not mean that an individual is struggling or has a low quality of life. One obvious example I can point out of this is the  fact that the poverty line for a single person living in America is said to be anyone making less than $11,770  while the average household income in china is stagnate at $10,220. Meaning that a single person who claims to be lower on the inequality scale because they live just around the poverty line is actually better off than the average Chinese household.

Third, I don't understand why it should matter if another person has more wealth than you do. If the general quality of life is improving for all people than why should it matter how that wealth is distributed. I personally believe that the reason income inequality is brought up is to satisfy feelings of entitlement. More and more Americans are beginning to feel that owning a personal vehicle is a right, or having access to the internet is a right. And while it is certainly true that we want people to experience the best quality of life that is possible I haven't seen any proof which suggests income inequality impacts a persons quality of life.

I look forward to reading your comments and I will try to reply to as many as I can.

TL;DR,

Income inequality does not matter because it has no impact on other parts of the economy, misrepresents whether a person is actually struggling or not, and does not impact a persons quality of life in any way.",2020-03-12 05:45:54,changemyview

CMV: I think wealth taxes and financial transaction taxes are both a bad idea,"Why are a wealth tax and financial transactions tax good ideas? I don’t understand the appeal of either. Can you change my mind?

I was originally Yang Gang, but now support Sanders for President. However, I think two of his financial reform proposals are terrible, terrible ideas.

Wealth taxes have never been successfully implemented, even in the Nordics Bernie likes to point to for support for universal healthcare (which I think is a 1000% great idea). This is for two reasons. First, it doesn’t recognize the mobility of capital. Unlike your labor, it’s very, very easy to move your wealth, especially if you’re wealthy. Tax avoidance for a wealth tax would be quite high due to the mobility of capital, and any attempts to stymie this would run the risk of decreasing liquidity. Second, marking wealth to market on an annual basis would be pretty difficult for many assets (e.g., real estate, trust assets, private business interests). I think it would be moderately easier for liquid, Level I investments (e.g., publicly listed securities), but marking illiquid assets to market would be very difficult. Once more, if most of my wealth is in illiquid assets, how do I come up with the cash to pay a wealth tax? 

I think a better way to address wealth inequality is drastically raising estate taxes. It accomplishes the goals of a wealth tax in one taxable (and definite) event, and is in line with the intentions of our Founding Fathers, who favored an inheritance tax to prevent aristocracy.

I also think a financial transactions tax is a bad idea that would ultimately punish everyday Americans. A real marvel of financial innovation over the past 50 years has been eliminating trading commissions, creating fractional share trading, and moving towards fee-based advisory models. Some of this is due to market disruption (RobinHood), others due to threatened regulation (the DOL rule, which should be reinstated). I think imposing a tax on something that the market worked so hard to create would be a terrible idea, because the ultimate goal of finance is to identify and allocate value, and do so in a way with minimum transaction costs. Implementing a tax would cost real Americans in their pension plans, 401(k)s, IRAs, HSAs, and brokerage accounts.

"CMV: Regardless of who wins the Democratic nomination, flipping the Senate is far more important than voting for your preferred candidate","I'll preface this with the fact that I am a non-American, watching the political debate from afar. I'm invested in the outcome because I have close family living in the US, and because American politics has a disproportional effect on the world at large regardless of whether Americans consider this a 'domestic' issue. I support Bernie because I believe him to be one of the few earnest people in politics, and because it seems that the US is in dire need of basic social welfare for it's citizens, something almost all other developed nations have gotten right. But I digress...

At this point in the race, while close, Biden has a definite edge, even if Reddit would rather upvote posts of Biden arguing 2nd Amendment rights with factory workers, arguing the Iraq War with Veterans, clips of his 'cognitive decline' or creeping on young women and kids on camera. Against my own hope, *it seems very likely that he will, in fact, get the nomination*.

I hear many Bernie supporters (some of whom are most definitely agent provocateurs, cosplaying-Republicans or trolls, some of whom are completely sincere) saying that they could never vote for Biden in the general, even if it means Trump wins, or that Biden getting the nomination means that Trump will win by default (that's for another discussion, but with Coronavirus looming and the impending economic crash, I think most people would vote for a wet rag rather than Trump come November).

As far as I'm concerned, while Biden may be a continuation of the Neoliberal Status-quo, another 4 years of Trump *should* be far more threatening to those who consider themselves left leaning in any fashion. Biden has done some remarkable things during his career, as well as a spectacular series of stupid things, but he's *still* better than Trump.

By not voting for Biden (if your choice is Bernie), you're allowing Trump to win in order to **own the Neo-libs**, and that makes you no better than those alt-right trolls you profess to hate.
Likewise, if you refuse to vote for Bernie (when you would have chosen Biden) for fear of some scary socialist revolution, you've lost the right to complain when Trump continues to shutter the CDC, the EPA and the State Department while Golfing on the job and stacking the courts with Republican judges for lifetime terms.

Beyond who leads the country, who controls the Senate is ultimately of more importance to the long term health of your nation.

Compromise, and make a change in incriments instead of throwing the baby out with the bathwater. I want a revolution too, but I'll accept closing border concentration camps full of children as a pretty great second choice.

CMV: The Republican Party is Bad for America,"I read this on a sub, and it resonated with me.  I agree with every part of it.  I'd love for someone to CMV!

[ That IS their plan. Loot the American economy of everything they can before abandoning us peasants to the ravages of globalization and seeking greener pastures for themselves and their kind. If they undo all the “safety net” socialism started by FDR, then there is even more money for them to steal. 

Reagan began the effort in earnest with a hefty tax cut that ended the “golden age” of progressive taxation, though he was soon forced to raise taxes again as the deficit predictably ballooned. When Clinton took office he had to raise taxes to cover the huge spending deficit Reagan had accumulated, which he did quite successfully. But as soon as the GOP again swept into office Bush gave away the budget surplus Clinton had left behind in another huge tax cut that primarily benefitted the rich, though he bribed working class folks with a $200 per person “rebate” that was a pittance compared to what the wealthy got. Bush once again spent us into an enormous deficit pursuing his useless “war on terror”, and nearly demolished our entire economy by further deregulating the banking and finance industry. Once again a Democrat had to rescue our economy from the marauding GOP, and Obama left Trump a healthy economy that had just a few years earlier been teetering on the edge of another Great Depression. 

Now once again the GOP president is cutting taxes for the rich while cutting benefits for the poor so there is more money to give to the rich. He is deregulating the banks, eliminating oversight, and otherwise doing whatever he can to make it easier for the rich to steal all our tax money. That’s all any GOP president ever does, has done for the last 40 years since the modern GOP coalesced. They try to steal from the poor and middle class to further enrich their wealthy patrons.

"CMV: Not wanting to abort is valid, being against the decriminalization of abortion is not.","It is simple, actually. The decriminalization of abortion is a law in favor of freedom of choice. The freedom of women to decide on their own body. That includes women who do not want to abort, as they can choose not to. The people and laws that criminalize abortion, on the other hand, do compel women NOT to abort **\*** due to a religiuos and/or moral vision that not all of us should or want to share.

Therefore, women who wouldn't perform an abortion (due to whatever reason) should still be in favor of the decriminalization of abortion, as it concerns their freedom as well. I think women —and people in general— who wouldn't perform an abortion, and don't want any woman to do so —which means, that are in favor of criminalizing abortion—, hate freedom, want to impose a religious/moral view, are authoritarian and, therefore, wrong. You may not want to abort —which is completely valid and respectable in a personal manner— but wanting other women to go to jail or die in clandestine abortion clinics because they don't share your view is no longer respectable or valid.

**\*** (And, by the way, banning something on paper does not mean erradicating it in real life. If you are in favor of criminalizing abortion, you are also in favor of clandestine abortion, for which thousands of women die every year around the world. That's why I don't like to call ""pro-life"" people who are actually ""pro-zygotes/embryos/fetuses"". But that's a different discussion.)

My point is: If you don't want to abort, for whatever reasons, don't abort. But don't try to pass laws that prohibit other women from doing so.

I am not interested if the pro-embryos as individuals do not want to abort —I would never try to make them change their opinion so that they perform an abortion; but it bothers me that they want to make their individual and personal opinion a law that reaches and governs everyone, regardless of our visions, thoughts and convictions, and that they want to impose their conservative and retrograde views on others (through laws).

It is as if a Jehova's Witness goes to the Senate and tries to pass a law that criminalizes blood transfusions only because their religion prohibits it. You may think that such a comparison is an exaggeration, but it is actually very accurate.

(Please don't come and tell me that embryos and zygotes are people, because that's not what the discussion is about. I do not think so, I have enough information not to believe it. The discussion is: why your moral and vision, proven wrong and numerously refuted, should be law in a secular and free State, above my moral and vision (specially if mine does not trample yours, as yours over mine does.)

CMV: an ultrasound before an abortion is not that big of a deal.,"The positive that is irrelevant but the first thing I thought of: The way I see it is that an ultrasound can pick up on things that might complicate an abortion. It would make it safer, if the doctor could see like a cyst or cancer that would be a very helpful thing. I’ve never had an abortion but I am surprised they don’t make you get an ultrasound (just for the doctor to see at least) for a medical procedure. 

As for women having to listen to the fetus heartbeat, I mean. It’s going to be emotional no matter what. It’s a big choice no matter what. Tons of women go in to the waiting room and leave after sitting down. Or they stop when they meet the doctor and go over the procedure. Some women don’t go through with it and they regret it and some women do go through with it and they regret it. The scenario where an ultrasound will change the outcome (abortion or not) depends so heavily on the woman and her situation I don’t think it’s going to change much at all.

If someone could enlighten me on this one last thing: if hearing the heart beat and then getting the abortion is traumatizing, wouldn’t the abortion have the same effect? 

Personally, I get annoyed when people try to cope in hard situations like this. Like when someone shoots another human being and they tell themselves “oh it’s just like shooting a deer” to make themselves feel better. It’s not like shooting a deer. If I have to kill someone, I will acknowledge it’s hard and that I am killing another human being because I will have to live with the consequences and the reality. If I have to get an abortion I don’t mind listening to the heartbeat before and the silence afterwards, because I need to live with the consequences and the reality. I cannot stand coping in serious situations because I will drive myself crazy. 

I don’t think hearing the heartbeat and seeing the ultrasound will change any outcome. Like I said, women get deterred from abortion without an ultrasound all the time. And the women who know for sure what they want I don’t think it will phase them.",2020-03-12 02:58:30,changemyview
CMV: Biden and Sanders are extremely similar and people saying they would vote for one but not the other don't make sense to me.,"Both Biden and Sanders agree on raising taxes on the very wealthy aggressively lowering carbon emissions, expanding healthcare and demilitarizing immigration. The American Conservative Union has their lifelong voting record scored within less than 6% difference. The idea that the legislation they would sign or veto would be very different is not supported by much evidence. There is no reason to be terrified of a socialist or a capitalist, here. 

They are both old white guys that have said and done creepy things, they both get publicly upset and hyperbolic, they both have serious ties to black communities, they both have big yikes in their voting record, and major accomplishments they should be proud of.

If I were a conspiracy theorist, I'd suspect that the trolls online insisting that Biden is a conservative are Biden campaign botnets designed to boost his chances in the general election, just as Sanders adopts a socialist label while admitting he ""isn't an expert"" on Scandinavian economies and condemning the Soviet Union as not real socialism.

Both of these people are experienced politicians playing their roles, and millions of people are gobbling it up because it's good theater.",2020-03-12 02:24:11,changemyview

"CMV: The stock market is largely governed by cyclical reasoning, and that's dangerous","This being r/changemyview, please understand that I'm not really asserting that any of what I'm saying is true, because I can't imagine that it is, which is why I'm posting this. I have to assume that everything I'm saying is absolutely moronic.

The U.S. stock market is currently tanking. This is, presumably, both because of the economic impact of COVID-19 and significant drops in the price of oil. People see that companies are losing value, so they sell their shares off before their worth drops too much.

The thing is, practically speaking, those share prices are only dropping *because* shareholders are selling them. If everyone agreed to *not* sell them, there would be very little negative consequence, except for the shareholders of those few companies that happen to get bought out or liquidated. Most non-dividend stocks are, practically speaking, make-believe. You might as well be selling trading cards. Take Apple's stock, for instance. ""Oh boy, I own 0.0001% of Apple!"" Great. What does that actually mean? Absolutely nothing. You aren't getting anything out of it, and no one's buying out Apple any time soon, so you won't get anything out of it for the foreseeable future. And yet you can, because people will buy this vague concept (voting rights, theoretically, which again gets you absolutely nothing) from you for actual currency, and when that company performs well or doesn't meet it's earnings target, the value of this vague, conceptual thing which has very little real connection to that company's value is going to change as well, because people believe that it should.

It's similar to an argument made by certain Christians regarding the Bible. They'll say ""The Bible is the inspired word of God, therefore everything it says is true and perfect."" How do you know The Bible is the word of God? ""Because The Bible says that it is."" (Do note that I'm not claiming that's the basis of the belief of most Christians, just that I've heard it.) ""Why are non-dividend shares in a company worth buying?"" ""Because the people buying them say they are.""

Point is, it seems to me that a significant chunk of the money in the U.S. is being converted to something even less tangible, and far more easily affected by emotion and general assumption. So now, along with the hard bits of the economy sometimes struggling, you get a double whammy, there's a weird ghost economy that gets all sorts of messed up too because people genuinely think it's worth investing money in something on the off chance that it eventually starts paying out dividends, is liquidated or bought by someone else. When so much actual currency is tied into that system, it makes the actual value of that currency way, way more unstable than it should be.",2020-03-12 01:07:38,changemyview
"CMV: If you claim to be an animal lover but use animal products, you don’t actually care for them","Before I get into my logic and all that, I’d like to clarify some things. First of all, when I say animal products, I‘m referring to the ones that are inherently cruel, like meat or leather, not things like eggs or wool, which can be farmed without harming the animals involved. Along with that, if it’s impossible for you to avoid animal products due to health problems, income, or anything you can’t control, this doesn’t apply to you. Lastly, I completely understand that it’s literally impossible to live your life without animal products, as no matter what you eat, there’s probably animal products involved, whether it’s bugs inside of your meal or beeswax coated on top of fruit to make it last longer. The people who I believe don’t actually care about animals are the ones who use animal products which can easily be avoided and aren’t necessary for day-to-day living.

Now, to explain my point, if you consider killing one animal immoral, but doing the exact same thing to another species is perfectly fine to you, you’re hypocritical. It doesn’t seem like you love animals if you’re willing to support the murder of a species you don’t like as much for your own personal gain. In my eyes, there is absolutely no difference between eating a cow and eating a dog, but people go ballistic over the idea of consuming the latter. The most common argument I’ve gotten in response to this statement was something along the lines of “we’ve bonded with dogs,” which I believe is a horrible argument because in the places people eat dogs, they’re not seen as pets, rather pests. Not to mention, there’s places where it’s not even remotely social acceptable to eat beef.

I’m not arguing that you’re a bad person if you use animal products and I really hope it , but I really don’t understand why it’s considered okay to call yourself an “animal lover” but use animal products and I would love to hear your arguments for it.",2020-03-12 00:58:30,changemyview

Imagine I have a family and I'm poor, many people have robbed banks or stores to get money for their families. To support their families, to help them survive. Usually, it's because they've been laid off in a hard time, or they were homeless in the beginning and they have nowhere to turn to. I understand that this idea is flawed because if we implemented this rule, homeless people would rob stores, and then get caught. That would help the homeless people who committed the crimes because the government would help them, but it would mean the crime rate would go up significantly. I like this idea, I know it's flawed.

I'm also tired of seeing people referring to АR15s or other semi аutomatic riflеs as ""аssault rifles"" or ""аssault wеаpons."" BTW the АR stands for Аrmalite riflе, not assаult riflе. In fact, there's no gцn that fits these criteria of being an assаult rifle a civiliаn in the US can normally possеss as it is illegаl for them to own fцlly automatic wеаpons.

Assаult riflеs must be capable of [selective fire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selective_fire).

A magazine is what you put in a gun, a clip is literally a small piece of metal which holds bullеts for storage. How the hell does banning this make anyone safer? There's few gцns that you can actually insert a clip into and they're all pretty old. There's also dumbаss pоliticians like [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rGpykAX1fo) who don't even know what they're actually trying to ban.

This dumbаss [politiciаn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRQqieimwLQ) thinks an incendiary tip allows the bullеt to follow a target, not start a fire upon impact which it actually does. You also got dumbаsses like [Blооmberg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV5E30ZY1kQ) who thinks all riflеs are аutomatic and pistоls are semiautоmаtic.

Warning shots are illеgal and can potentially be dangerous, you never fire into random directions, gцn safety 101. You also don't use up all your аmmo in a potentially dangerous situation, nor would you ever leave аmmo stored in a shotgцn as they are prone to accidentally discharges especially when dropped and that is illеgаl as well in many places.

Other miscоnceptions are pоliticians talking about what we need and don't need for hunting. Fцck off, our second amеndmеnt is for the people to have the ability to overthrow a tyrаnnical govеrnment, it literally says shall not be infringed. Any bаn on arms is an infringement. Not only was the second amеndmеnt intended for us to own gцns, but really anything that we the people would need to fight off the govеrnment. This includes tаnks, fighter jеts, еxplosives and really anything else. In the founding of this country there were legal privаte wаrships to protect against piracy or fight off the british.

I could fill this entire post with fцcking retаrded pоliticians who don't know anything about the laws they're passing that we have to deal with. If you're going to support an action or fцcking sign the legislаtion into action you need to actually know what you're talking about and not be like the jaсkasses i previously mentioned.

CMV: Lawrence Garbuz (the NY lawyer at the center of a coronavirus hotspot)'s name should have never been made public.,"Every single country with coronavirus cases has stated the importance of not releasing COVID-19 patients' names to the public. People who were exposed are contacted and quarantined, and the public sometimes learns where they work or places they visited. This has been the case with over 120,000 people so far, including those who died. The reason the names aren't released is simple: their lives wouldn't be the same. They risk being ostracized and losing their jobs, or even have their families targeted. It's not hard to harass someone on social media, the phone, or at their house if you have their name, age, and general location. It's also against the law in countries with medical provacy protections. 

So why the fuck do we know who Lawrence Garbuz is? Why are photos of he and his wife all over the news? His livlihood could very well be over if/when he recovers. Since so many cases were linked back to his synagogue, he could easily be ostracized from his place of worship, a place where he and his family have probably found belonging. People will no doubt blame him. His kids may be bullied or avoided, even once they've completely recovered. He runs a law firm that is now nationally recognized as being run by someone linked to dozens of infections - he'll probably lose a great deal of business. A town is in a containment zone now, and it wouldn't be hard for him to feel like people think it's all because of him. Imagine the toll on his mental health and his family's mental health.

No responsible news source would run his name AND PICTURE in a story because of the further damage it could do if it goes viral. Even if his wife made her social media statements before the news reported his name instead of after (I don't know which order that happened in), no ethical reporter would further publicize the man's information the way so many have.

## My Questions (and Changing My View)

I think that my main problem is that when I ask myself these questions, the answers I can piece together form the other side's position don't seem satisfying or consistent. There's gonna be many ways to change my view, but I think these questions are a good place to start.

* **Q1) What does it mean for a character's identity to be forced?** How do you tell if a character's identity has been forced on them?

* **Q2) Can all identities be forced?** How often are white, straight, or male characters described as being ""forced"" to be that way? 

* **Q3) What exactly justifies a character being non-white, non-male or non-straight?** If an author has a side character that does not really get any backstory or development, should they never be ""diverse""? How are modern writers doing a bad job of this?

* **Q4) Why do authors NOT have to justify male, white, cisgender, or straight characters' existence  with good writing or extensive backstories?** 

* **Q5) Is there a default identity?** Can we split humans into ""Diverse"" and ""Default""? Why are straight, white, cis males seen as default? How do cultural frameworks, geographic locations, and historical context change what's ""Default""? Is this a good thing for either the ""default"" or the ""diverse"" group?

* **Q6)** If non-straight, non-white, or non-male characters are pandering to non-white, non-straight, or non-male audience members, **do straight, white, or male characters pander to straight, white, or male audience members?** What is the difference between pandering to an audience and appealing to it? Why is pandering wrong?

* **Q7) Are we making too big a deal about representation?** What are some reasons representation isn't as important as some audience members and creators believe? What are some ways to do representation better? How do you tell if representation is organic?

---

## My Points

* **In real life, people are diverse.** So this is a fundamental one for me. I've lived all my life in cities, and I understand how different it is in suburban or rural areas, but for me both the ""main cast"" (i.e friends, family, teachers, coworkers/teammates) and the ""background characters"" (strangers on the bus, people I talked to once at a party) are rather diverse racially and sexually and politically. We all judge media through the lens of our own lives, and I feel that often when people call racial diversity ""unrealistic"" or ""forced"" they come from racially homogeneous or segregated places. It doesn't feel realistic because it's not part of _their_ reality, and it's okay to have that experience, what's not okay is projecting that to ""objective reality"".

* **In real life, sameness is often ""forced"".** This is racial segregation, gender segregation, and sexual repression essentially. A lot of people believe that knowing only straight people, or spaces where only straight people are visible are ""natural"". But I'm certain that couldn't be more forced as gay people are often forced by social pressures to remain invisible, or ostracized from groups because they become visible. Likewise, many people grow up in white communities whose whiteness was manufactured by (if not outright banning nonwhite members) policies like redlining and historical trends like economic disparity. 

* **In real life, non-straight, non-white, non-male, individuals (also) have stories worth retelling.** The main inspiration for all art is real life. The stories we make are about the stories we know. In places like America, whose founders were white men, we're way more likely to hear the bits of history that star white men. Because of that, sometimes it takes deliberate effort to seek out the stories of other demographics. But if you do look, you find that heroism, adventure, badassery, honor, and drama are found across all demographics. 

* **Realism is judged in proportion to what we know.** If you grew up only learning European History, only seeing stories with male protagonists, and never knowing that certain historical figures were queer, you'd believe such stories to be the norm and wouldn't think that the set of stories you learned was artificially manipulated. If you then are exposed to a more comprehensive view of history (one that looks at women and queer people and people outside the West) through fiction, then *that* will feel artificially manipulated.

* **It's harder to spot pandering when it targets us.** Pandering is not new or part of any modern political ideology. Pandering to an audience is, in fact, the basic most fundamental media strategy since forever because obviously we are more likely to consume things that pander to us. I contend that, say, video games have historically pandered to straight white young men because that was the demographic that was consuming video games. That is, it's not necessarily a macabre trend, but a business-minded one. Action games appeal to the power fantasies of these demographics by making the player character look like what the player looks like (or wishes he looked like), that's part of the appeal of them the escape and the fantasy.

* **As audience demands change, so will media supply.** Often ""Forced Diversity"" is framed as this top-down phenomenon, where some ""SJW"" elite commands hollywood and game studios and writers to write diverse stories. I contend that this framework misses the economic aspects of media. Early television is marked by white casts and black characters played by white actors in blackface. Racism was a principal contributor to this, but there was also an economic element (itself affected by institutional racism): it was only white families that had televisions in their homes. As black people entered the media market in the latter half of the century, channels like BET and genres like the ""black sitcom"" rose to prominence. Likewise, right now, women play more videogames than ever before, queer individuals are in a societal position where they can seek out and consume queer-themed content, and the democratization of media (i.e social media) means the voices of new audiences can be heard by studios. It's only natural the supply of these stories should rise to meet their demand.

## What My View Is Not.

* I am **NOT** saying there isn't a business-minded or political undertone in the inclusion of minorities in modern media. **INSTEAD**, I'm saying these undertones have always been present in all casting/character design decisions but have become more jarring as their focus has shifted to other demographics.

* I am **NOT** saying that people who feel diversity is ""forced"" are necessarily racist/homophobic/sexist. **INSTEAD,** I am saying that there are unacknowledged biases and life experiences that prevent critics from assessing what realistic diversity looks like.

* I am **NOT** saying that diverse media is by necessity good. **INSTEAD,** I am saying that diversity in media is both pretty realistic and often unfairly judged by audiences as a result of their biases.

CMV Putin can’t be proven to be more of a dictator than a leader like Franklin D. Roosevelt was,"At high water mark in 1936, FDR won the presidency with 98.49% of electoral votes, and at low mark he won 81.46% of electoral votes in 1944. I use electoral votes rather than popular votes because if a person wanted to rig an American election they would need to focus on electoral votes, and as the assumption is that Putin has rigged his elections based completely on popular vote to win in Russia I am using the equivalent force in US elections. 

Meanwhile, Putin’s high water mark in the 2018 election was 76.69% of votes, and his low water mark in the 2000 election was 53.4% of votes. From this comparison, we cannot base the assumption of Putin being a dictator on stealing elections alone unless we’re going to say that one of the most popular presidents in US history probably stole all of his elections. 

Now, a dictator may be considered an absolute ruler, which Putin is legally not, or equivalent to a “tyrant” which is a person who rules without regard to laws, which Putin is also officially not. There is much debate about the legitimacy of his Constitutional reforms in Russia, but the fact is that they’re going completely through the legal channels and being passed. You can allege that the lawmakers are in his pocket, but I again entreaty you to glance back at our boy FDR, who  passed 13 pieces of major legislation as part of his New Deal program within his first 100 days in office– even more cheeky than Vlad doing it after being in office for nearly two decades in one respect or another. 

Finally, I’ll point to the length of time in office. Prior to the US capping terms at two, FDR was set to be in office for 16 consecutive years until he died in office shortly after swearing in for his fourth term. The term limits were passed suspiciously right after his presidency, to prevent another president from wielding that much power. Meanwhile, Putin has been President of Russia for nearly 16 years non-consecutively, split in the middle when he was Prime Minister from 2008-2012, though it is widely supposed that he still controlled the political force of the country at this time. So depending on the metric, Putin has lead Russia for 16-20 years, which is comparable to what FDR won for himself and would have served had it not been for an untimely death.

"CMV: People who do believe it's justifiable to drive faster than the speed limit are the cause of general traffic problems, not the people who are ""driving too slow"" (in reality, the speed limit) by not conforming with the de facto, arbitrary speed limit.","&gt;Quick note: in most of the US, if the majority of traffic is driving faster than the speed limit, the faster speed is now the speed limit. Either keep up with traffic, or stay to the right.  
&gt;  
&gt;Dude's still an idiot driver, though.

I just had a lengthy, rather stupid debate on another Subreddit arguing against a few similar comments (mainly because I wanted to think through my own thoughts). Basically, it is a viewpoint shared by many drivers that ""slower"" (speed-limit-abiding) drivers cause traffic problems by ""*forcing* faster drivers to make ""dangerous maneuvers."" Anyway, I came up with the following summary of my viewpoints:

* The legal speed limit is not arbitrary and was chosen by engineers and experts in traffic analysis because it is in their opinion safest and optimal for car travel (less emissions). A search on Google yields many government websites stating this. The posted limit even typically already has taken into account the typical speeds of drivers (based on the 85th percentile speed).
* Drivers are safer when everyone drives the same speed, and less safe when people drive different speeds. This was the core of a couple other Redditors' arguments, but in using it, they ignored the principle that this *same speed* would be safest if it were the optimal speed as chosen, not arbitrarily decided upon by drivers.
* People are selfish and ignorantly believe that they are smarter than engineers and experts, and that because there is no clear and present danger of speeding, there is no problem. Regardless of whether or not it is generally accepted as okay to drive over the speed limit, the people deciding on this have made their opinion out of ignorance (presumably not all drivers are traffic analysis experts) and selfishness (they want to get somewhere fast, not caring about the effects it might have on other drivers). Offhand, I can think of endless examples where the majority has been dangerously wrong, especially for selfish reasons. Just look at climate change as a start.
* To conform to traffic and drive at the speed limit that others have arbitrarily decided on, ignoring laws and expert opinion, would also mean risking getting fined by the police. There is no ""forcing faster drivers to change lanes,"" because breaking the law and driving too fast is a choice, and an illegal one at that. If anything, it is these drivers that are forcing you to drive faster to counteract the increased probability of an accident they're creating by tailgating, etc.
* No matter what speed you're driving, or in whichever lane, if the speed limits aren't heavily enforced and people are arbitrarily choosing to go faster speeds (rather than the legal limit) and believing that people obeying the speed limits are getting in their way, these drivers will be tailgating and likely passing on the right. This also applies strongly on roads that aren't multi-lane roads.
* If everyone were to follow the laws and drive the speed limit, everyone would be driving the same speed while also driving at a speed that engineers have figured out will reduce accidents and increase vehicular efficiency.
* The cops and speed traps people complain about are there to enforce the law and this extremely basic idea.

I accept the fact that I might be making an error in reasoning here, since practically it might not be possible to strictly enforce the speed limit all of the sudden, nor would it be logical to think the government would all of a sudden choose to enact such a policy. I'm curious to hear opinions about my thoughts.",2020-03-11 22:05:46,changemyview

CMV: There is only 2 genders,"This post has probably appeared in this subreddit so many times, and i apologize for that. 

&amp;#x200B;

essentially here is what I am saying

Firstly gender

1. Being trans is not a separate gender if anything it strengthens the gender dichotomy
2. Being non binary is not a separate gender it just means you do not associate with either female or male. It is like asking somebody if they are hungry, are you? no. are you full? no. So you are something entirely different and we need to make a new category for you? No, I am just not hungry or full...

&amp;#x200B;

Sex

1. Being XXY gives you male characteristics
2. Being X0 gives you female characteristics 
3. being XXX also makes you female 
4. Being XYY also makes you male 
5. Some people are born with both female and male parts, again this means you are either female or male not a separate category

&amp;#x200B;

So when it comes to gender (which is not sex) either you are a male or a female, or neither or both, I struggle to imagine a category which eliminates this dichotomy entirely and presents itself as something new.",2020-03-11 21:01:38,changemyview
CMV: Coughing into your sleeve should be a practice that is taught to children from a young age in all American schools.,"It is absolutely mind boggling to me that this ain’t a federally mandated law. All children should receive instruction in schools so they can start the habit young. 

We are in the beginning stages of a pandemic and it confuses me as to why people still feel comfortable coughing out in public spaces without covering their fucking mouths. It’s disgusting and childish. As a child, my parents always corrected me if they saw me cough without covering my mouth WITH SLEEVES. Now it’s a habit that I always practice. 

From what I’ve seen, MOST people don’t do this, even in a country like America. I’m in college and both of the roommates that I’ve had will cough out into the open with no regards for my health. It’s not uncommon to be walking the streets and have someone just cough out into the air. I’ve sat at the table with a friend while eating and have had him just cough right over both of our plates. 

I’m not a medical professional, but I have to assume that pandemics like Coronavirus could be at least marginally mitigated if we all collectively participated in the practice of coughing into our sleeves/inner elbow. This should be something that is taught in schools so the habit is instilled in childhood.",2020-03-11 20:46:04,changemyview
CMV: Laws against statutory rape are unethical.,"When such laws define statutory rape as having sex with a minor and ignore whether or not the minor is competent and gave consent.

The reason I consider these laws unethical is because they imply the ability to consent is a function of age. This however is simply untrue, for ability to consent is a function of competence.

Although the VAST majority of minors are incompetent, these laws ignore the very few that are competent. Restricting the autonomy of such individuals goes against the principle of equality and justice, and is thus unethical.

I should probably note that my argument saying these laws are unethical is different from saying the laws should be changed (if I don't say this someone will definitely strawman me). I don't think these laws should necessarily be changed (they definitely shouldn't be removed entirely). Doing so may allow child rapists to say ""but they were competent!"" Ignoring the fact that minors are almost never conpetebt, changing these laws may allow more child rapists to escape justice, which is bad.



What would probaly change my mind about this issue?

Well, if you can demonstrate how such laws don't go against the principle of equality and justice when the minor is competent and gives consent.

Or if you could prove that it's impossible for a minor to be competent. I don't see how someone could do this though. People don't just magically become competent at the age of majority. Furthermore, there's already precedence of children being found competent when it comes to medical decisions.



Why I hold this belief?

It's really from just looking at the ethics of these laws. They violate ethical principles, it's as simple as that. Perhaps I should note that I'm looking at it deontologicaly, at the individual level. I'm sure you can come to a different conclusion using utilitarian ethics. Put deontological ethics is really the only theory that works in the hands on level.",2020-03-11 20:37:43,changemyview
CMV: Billionaires are the product of a strong and fair society,"\*Billionaires

Not a few

over 500. 

Most billionaires do not actually have a billion dollars in their bank account, they own a percentage of a company which is liquid due to stocks and shares etc. Therefore the wealth of the company is dependent on how other people view the company from the outside. Bezos net worth could be cut more than half if amazon stock dropped to $500 after the recent stock market crash. Most of the value of these people is based off of economic security. For example if we collectively believe .com names to be worth something based off of our strong judicial system and precedent, then they will be worth a seemingly gross amount of money, but this also switches the system from large oligarchies controlling resources to personal interest. Some people will always suffer no matter what the economy is, but for the most part I would say most of these billionaires are a good sign for everybody else. The poor is not getting poorer, rather the poorer are getting poorer compared to how many more people are becoming rich, the inequality is growing amongst many people, not just a handful.

CMV: The coronavirus is being used to usher in the cashless society - and it is just around the corner.,"It is being used to chip away at some social norms already. People are talking about avoiding shaking hands, and here in Europe people are suggesting an end to the double kiss. In a few weeks, people will start saying ""Look, if we are avoiding shaking peoples hands in order to not get sick, while at the same time handling dirty cash that's been in thousands of other people's dirty hands, then that's even worse than shaking hands"". -don't forget, some crazy fuckers actually lick their fingers as they count out their notes and bills.

It doesn't matter if the virus kills 3 people or 3 million, the result will be the same now. The important thing now is that it has transcended itself and become a media phenomenon that is making us very conscious about the way we behave and what things we touch on a daily basis.

CMV: We as humans have control over depression.,"I've noticed lately that I have a very unpopular opinion. I feel as though people who claim to struggle with depression (not ALL mental health issues, just depression) do so because they themselves are not doing enough to prevent it. I do believe that we as humans can become depressed, but I don't believe that those with *chronic* depression have a ""condition"". I believe that they're just giving in to depression.

I believe that by trying hard enough and making lifestyle changes, one can ""cure"" their depression on their own. There may be outside forces (weather, other humans, unfortunate events, etc.) that influence our moods, but it is ultimately us who choose how to respond to those outside forces.

Recently, my brother threatened suicide in front of the police and was taken to a mental health hospital. I am open to hearing from those who have struggled with depression as well, and what they did to try to cure their depression on their own, and what the outcome was.

CMV: 9/11 was orchestrated by the Bush Administration,"So some background about me, although I am critical of many official narratives surrounding events within international politics I would never call myself a conspiracy theorist. I have read into many of the big conspiracies like Pizzagate, CIA Coronavirus, MH17 to name a few and many of them have holes or aspects I find hard to believe. But there is one conspiracy that I've been unable to shake for several years, and that's 9/11. The thing is I'd love to be assured that Bush wasn't involved in 9/11, it might give me a little more faith in humanity, but to date there are some aspects, or as the government claims 'coincidences', of the September 11th attacks that I find very hard to ignore.

Here is my main list:

1) the collapse of World Trade Centre 7, This building hadn't been hit by any aircraft, yet collapsed entirely due to fire damage. To my knowledge this is the only time in history that a steel structured skyscraper has collapsed entirely because of fire. What's more interesting is that in the 9/11 report WTC7's collapse was not mentioned a SINGLE time. Further still the building was home to the IRS who supposedly were investigating members of the Bush administration.

2) At least several (or if I'm not mistaken ALL) of the WTC hijackers were identified because their passports were found among rubble practically unscathed from a fire that was supposedly so strong it melted steel beams. Surely these passports would have been one of the first things to get obliterated? 

3) This brings me on to my next point, ""jet fuel can't melt steel beams"" I know it's a bit of a cliche/meme these day but it's still a valid point nonetheless.

4) The attack seemed like the perfect justification for war in the Middle East. It even made the invasion of Iraq seem reasonable to many Americans. Equally it gave domestic law enforcement and intelligence agencies a big power upgrade through legislation like The PATRIOT Act.

5) The 9/11 commission report, a report of the official investigation into 9/11 was incomplete, inaccurate and massively underfunded. To put it into context the report investigating Clinton's extramarital affair received multiple times more funding, yet it seems for the largest terrorist attack ever committed on US soil funding was limited.

I must apologise as there may be some minor discrepancies in regards to my information but I'm quite confident the vast majority of this information is spot-on. Please point it out otherwise.

"CMV: The electoral college shouldn't be abolished, but states should start using the Maine/Nebraska system","I fully understand that the electoral college method of electing the president was created to give power to slave states who had lots of people but not very many citizens. Being able to count slaves as 3/5s of a person when determining number of representatives and therefore number of electoral votes gave much more power to southern voters. This is not what I want to debate, but just wanted to get it out of the way.

My thoughts on the electoral college is that it gives more voice to the rural states who would likely be left out in a popular vote scheme. Yes, this means that individual voters in high population states have ""less powerful"" votes, but their state as a whole still has more power in the election than a rural state. However, the current winner-takes-all system also basically discounts the votes of those whose politics don't align with the majority of voters in a state. Instead of a winner takes all method, I believe we should go to a congressional district distribution like Maine and Nebraska use. For those unaware, in those two states, whoever gets more votes in each congressional district gets the single electoral votes from that district, and whoever wins the state overall gets the two ""senatorial"" votes. 

In this system there's still a boost in importance to rural states, giving them the voice they need, but also allows for popular vote to be more in play, making it necessary for candidates to appeal to everyone in country geographically. Take California and Texas as examples. In California, conservatives often feel their vote doesn't matter because the state almost always goes blue, despite rural Cali being quite conservative. In Texas the reverse is true. In a congressional district system, candidates would have to try to win the OC and Austin, appealing to the ALL the people in these states, rather than just assuming the democratic nominee will get the 55 from Cali with no sweat, and the republican nominee the 38 from Texas. It would also make it much harder for the candidate who wins the college to lose the popular vote.

I believe this system would be a good compromise of both the electoral college and the popular vote.",2020-03-11 18:20:30,changemyview

I’m trying to listen to people’s reasonings about why he is a good candidate and all I hear is; he was Obama’s VP and he is a moderate Dem, and we need to beat trump so vote blue no matter who. 

I have a problem with all of these points tho because just because he was an ally for the first black president, doesn’t mean he was an ally for the black community (ie his crime bill, segregation busing policies etc). 

He’s also just so establishment (bought by corporations and wealthy interested rather than that of the people) and so many of his voting histories and policies are similar to Trump (not establishing women’s right to choose, no legal marijuana, no healthcare, no environmental reform). 

I believe if he becomes president, MAYBE we’ll get those babies at the boarder out of cages but Obama’s administration was horrible with separating children so I simply believe by putting Joe Biden in office well have quieter more secret corruption. At least with Trump we have a febrile outburst and transparency with his corruption.

"CMV: The people calling COVID-19 the Chinese Flu, the Wuhan Flu, the Bat Soup Virus, etc. are assholes for further spreading racism and prejudice against Asians","In 2015, the WHO promulgated [new rules](https://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/notes/2015/naming-new-diseases/en/) for naming diseases, years before the current outbreak. They observed the stigma and prejudice created by MERS and other diseases named after places, and citing to and learning from those mistakes, declared going forward new diseases would no longer be named after places.

Since the COVID-19 epidemic began, there have been stories from [around the world](https://time.com/5797836/coronavirus-racism-stereotypes-attacks/) of racist hysteria and attacks against Asians, often against Asians who aren't Chinese at all and are citizens who were born in the country where they're attacked. 

Meanwhile, some [politicians are making it a point](https://www.gq.com/story/coronavirus-is-not-chinese) to use the racially charged terms. I don't even need to link to the widespread usage of people using mocking racially charged terms for the virus here on Reddit, often hugely upvoted on mainstream subreddits.

Now, certainly racism and prejudice would have still existed to some degree whatever the name of the disease was. However, there can be greater and lesser degrees of racism and prejudice, and the entire rationale behind the rule was the concrete observation that naming conventions in the past further inflamed the hatred.

A lot of the people using terms like China Flu here on Reddit pat themselves on the back for their bold stands against the Chinese government. Whatever the merits of their stand against the Chinese government, I don't think taking the stand by using language that demonizes the ethnicity is laudable at all, in fact, I think it makes them assholes. There are plenty of ways to demonstrate one's hatred of the Chinese government without further exacerbating a situation where people are already being hurt by racist attacks. Furthermore, a good rule is being undermined simply because they don't like the people it applies to.

America didn't adequately prepare enough tests and ran into early issues with its planned system. I personally went to the doctor with 1.5 weeks of COVID-like symptoms and was told I had a ""viral upper respiratory infection"" and that they were still developing their test, but if they felt my symptoms were warranted they would contact me again later.

America's lack of testing coupled with the president's consistent contradicting of the statements of experts, gag orders placed on federal experts, and lack of shutdowns in areas the government can control (government facilities, air and train travel) was the direct cause of WHO's declaration of a pandemic.

I imagine it's being made back by others who will buy, but that's a different point.

CMV: The coronavirus IS NOT being overblown,"I see people posting on social media all sorts of stuff about how coronavirus is being overblown, but it really doesn't seem like it is. So far 121,000 people have been infected and 4300 of those have died. That's about 3.5%. Now, that doesn't seem like a big number, but it's an incredibly contagious virus, and if say, even 10 million total people end up getting it, thats 350,000 people dead right there. The quarantine does not seem overkill to me.   

Is there a small minority of stupid people overreacting and buying 1000 rolls of TP like its the zombie apocalypse? Of course there are, there's always people like that, however i do not think the worldwide response of quarantine and cancelling/postponing large public gatherings is overreacting at all because of how contagious the virus is.   

[Look at this for example](https://thehill.com/changing-america/well-being/prevention-cures/482794-officials-say-the-cdc-is-preparing-for).

CMV:I believe that in some cases it is better to let one innocent person suffer than let ten guilty people go free,"Blackstone's ratio is the idea that

&gt; ""It is better that ten guilty persons escape than that one innocent suffer.""



This is a concept I think most people generally agree with. One person going to prison or suffering due to being accused of a crime they did not commit is unacceptable and inexcusable. I think in a real world application, it doesn't always hold up. In some cases it becomes similar to the trolley problem. 

If you were shown 11 people, 10 of them murdered someone and the other is innocent. If I ask you to choose to let them all go free, or make them all go to prison for life, you might say let them all go if you agree with Blackstone's ratio. 

What if the 10 murderers will all try to murder again. Some might fail, others may kill multiple people before being caught. Let's say on average they will kill 1.5 people each if they are set free. 


So now I'm asking you whether to put 10 murderers and 1 innocent person in prison for life, or let them all go and 15 innocent people will die. Or more simply, is it better for 1 innocent person to suffer or 15 innocent people to die?

I think anyone that would save the group over the individual in the trolley problem would also agree that 1 innocent person going to prison is better than 15 people dying. Even if the 10 murderers were not as successful at future murders, 2 innocent people dying is still worse than 1 innocent person going to prison.

If we were talking about con men or bank robbers, it would be different. Letting 10 bank robbers go free knowing 5 banks will get robbed is probably preferable over 1 innocent person being imprisoned. (Assuming those robbers aren't killing people during the robberies.)",2020-03-11 16:50:20,changemyview
CMV: There Should Be No Private Prisons,"&amp;#x200B;

Hello Everyone!

I would like to present the idea that privatized, for profit prisons should be banned.

Recently, private prisons have become an increasingly popular method  of incarcerating inmates. While private prisoners still make up a  minority of the overall prison population, there has been a 40% increase  in private prison population since 1999.

Private prisons earn there money and multiple ways. In some cases,  they are paid to take in prisoners that otherwise would not be housed  anywhere. This is a huge problem, because it encourages private prisons  to have MORE convicts, and this means mass incarceration.  Private  prison systems are constantly lobbying for policies such as 3 strikes  rule, drug criminalization and the housing of immigrants in their  detention centers.

In order to lower operating costs, these prisons cut corners. They  train employees less, pay them less, and hire them less. This has lead  huge problems. They have 28% higher inmate on inmate assault rates and  twice the amount of inmate on staff assaults.

They also have subpar medical and mental heath facilities, with  substantially higher suicide rates. Prisoners are often not given proper  medical treatment, if they recieve treatment at all.

Convince me why these private, for-profit prisons deserve to exist.",2020-03-11 16:48:33,changemyview

People under the age of 18 or in some cases 21 are not mature enough to make life changing decisions. What they decide now , they might regret it later.

My very good friend (22F) was always a kind of a tomboy and hanged out with me and other group of boys. On her 16th birthday she came out . We were accepting and her parents were fully supportive. She soon became actively involved  in many Transgender forums and LGBTQ communities online nad IRL .Then she took her decision to go with an operation when she turned  20 . She told us that she felt more happy as a proper boy . We were a bit concerned at first and asked her if she thought through this properly, she sounded sure of it and we showed all our support . Her parents were also really concerned and were against it, but for the sake of her happiness and because of the continuous persuasion by her  they allowed it . Fast forward a few weeks after the surgery, she became very depressed. She was suddenly very very paranoid and conscious. She went to therapy for a year and a half and showed signs of recovery but ultimately she committed suicide on Jan 6th of last year . It happened all too suddenly. On such a short notice. No note nothing. 

This experience taught me a lot of things, one mainly being that we are not as mature as we think we are.

CMV: We need an independent body that fact checks news sites and politicians,"The exact implementation of this is something i'm not completely sure about, it would require careful planning and safeguards to ensure that it doesn't lean one way or another. This would be difficult I'll concede that. 

However if possible, is this not be something that we definitely need? 

News reporting is increasingly becoming an echo chamber of one sides views, it's no wonder everyone hates each other and thinks that if you have opposing views you must be descended from Satan himself. 

If this could be stopped it would be of extreme benefit to everyone and help keep democracy fairly close to it's roots. 

As a general idea I would have it fact check news articles, politicians speeches, basically all forms of mass media. If they find inaccuracies or outright lies they will fine the company/party based on some criteria. 

Something along the lines of,     

1. **level of inaccuracy** (by how much was this media misrepresenting what was being reported on?, if reports were accurate for the time of release but have since changed then no action is taken. early reports from ongoing situations will also be treated lightly. If the media is deemed to be inaccurate due to clerical errors (extra zero in numbers, 3 deaths instead of 2)  the piece must be recalled and a statement given addressing it's inaccuracy, however no fines will be given. Heavy fines will only be given when the intent of the media is to mislead or to misrepresent a case in order to support an agenda. These cases wold be the main focus of the body.)

2.  **amount of people influenced by this media** (number of people who were subjected to this   
media under the impression that it was factual and fairly represented what was being reported.   
this would only apply to those who have directly consumed this media, indirect cases will not be   
counted due to impossiblity to verify numbers e.g word of mouth, multiple people reading one   
newspaper etc.)

3. **damage caused to others by this media (**If this media misrepresents a case or person in a way   
that damages their reputation, influences court proceedings or misleads voters it will be given a   
level of severity based on how much damage is determined to have been done)

The more severe each of these criteria, the heavier the fine. 

Since it impossible to check every piece of media, it would mainly observe those with the highest viewerships and try and limit misinformation to the greatest extent.

Explicitly stated opinion pieces will not be subject to this bodies interference, however anything published with no context and gives the impression that it is fact will be scrutinized.",2020-03-11 14:24:40,changemyview

CMV: You should be able to become president at 18," 

Why is there an age requirement past being a fully grown adult?

When have we been shown that older people are smarter or more capable than younger people?

As far as achievements are concerned, people generally peak at around 21. It's pretty much downhill from there.

The beatles revolutionised music in their 20s, bill gates most important contributions to microsoft were in his 20s, Einstein revolutionised physics in his 20s. When was the last time you heard someone actually do something as valuable in their 60s or 70s? 

Now these examples are of course not related directly to running a country, but are just something to put things into perspective, these are the people who brought us ahead into the new age in some way or another. 

 A major factor never considered is the huge disconnect between someone who is say, 70 from the rest of the population, they're still living in the 60s/70s to a large extent. How can you expect them to being up to date socially and accurately consider the future of the country?

If you look to the greatest leaders of most countries, quite a large amount of them are reasonably young, or at least were when they did their most praiseworthy acts.

CMV: Bernie Sanders supporters are far more likely to vote for Joe Biden rather than the other way around.,"Hey guys,

Democratic primaries are in way in the states and it’s becoming increasingly likely that Joe Biden will be the Democratic nominee. I personally believe that it has wound up this way due to the American Media, DNC, and other political groups encouraging a narrative of “electability” and consistently favoring Biden with non-sensical support largely due to the fact that moderate Democrats only truly flocked to him once the other younger, or more liberal moderate choices dropped their campaign (some like Buttigieg who had next to no reason to do so when he did)

All that being said it looks like Bernie supporters, or Bernie Bro’s as they’ve been unfortunately called, are going to have to take an L and make a choice in the General Election to vote for Biden, abstain, or (disgustingly) vote for Trump.

As much as I dislike what has happened in the Democratic Primary, the way in which Democrats are proving all the negative criticism I’ve heard Republican supporters say about them over the last 12 years, Joe Biden as president is phenomenally better than 4 more years of Trump. Trumps has been in modern times the absolute epitome of what’s wrong with America, a bullshitting white supremacist war mongerer who lies, disrespects the media (like I did but worse) to the point of threatening our freedom of speech, twitter addicted, tv addicted, self aggrandizing manipulator of government football strategizing folks like Mitch McConnell and others to prop up himself his family and more with the other fortyish presidents of the country. It’s disgraceful.

But when I continue advocating and have advocated for Bernie online I find an increasing backlash and a lot of presumptuous claims on behalf of what I assume are more moderate voters. For instance, I’ve been told I’m racist for wanting resisting Joe Biden - who was part of the biggest bipartisan crime regulation effort of the eighties that overwhelmingly passed minimum mandatory sentences for minor drug charges, police crackdown on essentially minority neighborhoods, and thus enabling another 3 decades of racist policing to take place unchecked and allowing the justice system to take advantage of disadvantaged people’s and put them in private prisons. But you know Obama VP so he cool.

It’s been assumed I will abstain or vote for Trump.

It’s disgusting that I have to get that kind of backlash for supporting a progressive candidate. Democrats lost big in 2008 - 2010 when they tried to play moderate on healthcare and economic bailouts. Democrats have struggled to gain any foothold for long periods since the Reagan era of politics and it’s largely because of this overwhelming idea that is increasingly clear - Democrat’s have stopped being the party of liberal progress and have become the party of Moderate Centrism.

Still preferable and I’ll vote for Joe but I also think everyone who assumes different is ignorant. Not only ignorant but very high and mighty in precisely the kind of Ivory Tower way that people presume and portray Democrats as being.

I went to college. I have a masters degree. I live a middle class lifestyle in a decent city in the Midwest. I understand the value of not being a bigot, seeing other sides of the argument, and even the value of joining two opposing sides to work towards meaningful solutions.

The past 4 years has made it clear, Republican power is corrupt. It is nothing to meet in the middle. It would skew so far right, and again, has in the past, because of their unwillingness to do anything other than win. Trump was a huge surprise to traditional conservatives, but what did their representatives do? Played ball.

Biden wants to play ball and I’ll vote him because anything is better than Trump. I don’t believe if the Primaries go in a different way that Biden’s moderate supporters would show up in a general election. That has always been the argument for “electability” and that is why I believe they are elitist. To think that playing ball with monsters is more progressive or valuable than showing a President like Bernie can be elected in America is fucking mind blowing to me. It’s incredibly stupid, exactly the move they tried in 2016, and quite frankly Joe is a far worse candidate than Hillary.

"CMV: In the age of the internet, mainstream media critics are obsolete.","Reviewers and critics are a long-standing tradition in media, but I believe their time has come to an end.

At best, they are not harmful. Not particularly helpful, but not harmful. For people who don't have much of an interest in media, they can glance at a movie review in the paper and have a vague sense of what a movie is about and how good it might be.

However, for everyone else, we just go to rotten tomatoes or metacritic and look at what users are saying. There can be problems with this of course, which I'll discuss below, but for the most part, this system should replace traditional professional media critics.

The only real purpose I can think of for mainstream media critics now is to give people a ""sneak peek"" of how something might be before it's released. The problem with this is that I believe we're entering a cultural zeitgeist where critics are more concerned with their own careers and reputation as opposed to giving the fans a genuine and useful perspective on the media that they review. Ideology and image seem to be taking precedence over critical review. 

You're probably well aware of how often critics and fans have sharply different opinions on things. This is really a quite bizarre phenomenon that shouldn't exist. You can argue that often times the fanbase for certain media franchises are very toxic, and so you should not trust user review scores on sites like rotten tomatoes and metacritic.

But I think there are enough cases where this is clearly not the case, to the point where we can start to be very suspicious of the motivations of media critics.

Just off the top of my head I think of superhero TV series like Supergirl, Batgirl, and the last two (?) seasons of Doctor Who. Maybe some commenters can provide other examples.

All of these instances gave us glowing critic reviews, but abysmal user reviews. They can't both be right. Subjectivity obviously comes into play here, but there should not be such a stark and sharp contrast between traditional mainstream media critics and actual fans. Something is awry.

This is where I think we are being shown the truth of what's going on: these shows are utilizing social messaging in their series which makes a majority of  professional critics absolutely terrified of giving them a bad or even mediocre score.

Of course you can make the argument that basement dwelling trolls are projecting their own toxic worldview and giving a show an undeservedly low score based on the same social messaging that drives critics to give mostly glowing reviews, even if it doesn't deserve it.

I personally believe both of these scenarios are true, but one is much more true than the other. I think it's quite clear that professional critics are all on the same team. They want to promote the social messaging in these shows and films and that is their primary motivation. I think the limited number of professional critics gives us a pretty clear picture of what's going on. There's simply not enough diversity of opinion in this pool of people to demonstrate a true critical eye being used in these reviews.

Here's why I think the user scores **can** be trusted, however: while there are certainly a lot of trolls who are just joining a brigade of negativity, there are a lot of people who are writing reviews to go along with their scores which I believe demonstrate if not a ""professional"" level of writing, they do demonstrate a genuine love and appreciation of the franchise in question, with rational and genuine criticisms. There are much more of these kinds of reviews to find, dozens at least, if not hundreds - and they might generally give us a negative or mediocre view of the movie or series in question.

Meanwhile, there are not enough critical reviews that match the perspective put forth by the users. I hope this is making sense. There is clearly something strange going on, and I believe it's because the critics are a part of an elitist community which very closely scrutinizes their published pieces, which of course reflect their values and worldview as a person. Because of this ""invisible gun to your head"" kind of environment, I don't believe professional critics can any longer be trusted to give unbiased reviews of shows with heavy handed social messaging.

I'm from the UK and our last election was my first being able to vote, as was the same for pretty much all of my friends.

CMV: We can't save the environment with market-based solutions (only),"Hi guys, so my point is:

We see a lot of ""market-based"" instruments when it comes to topics as fighting climate change, protecting the oceans, saving the Amazon rainforest etc. And I just don't think those instruments won't accomplish enough to solve environmental problems. 

When I talk about ""market-based"" solutions I talk about legislation that manages incentives for corporations and citizens - in stark contrast to ""hard legislation"", such as outlawing specific actions. A market-based solution would be to allow a certain cap on fossil fuels to use, while ""regulation"" in my understanding as a counterpart to it would ban the use of fossil fuels (maybe under certain conditions). Let me explain it with an example.

The most commonly known ""market-based"" approach to save the environment might be the trade of CO2 certificates. While I agree that they have some effect, I don't think that this instrument does enough to spare us real regulation when it comes to aviation or individual transport by non-electric cars. While in theory, the current system incentivizes not to harm the environment, it *actually* incentivizes corporations to continue to do harm to the environment (as in: to us all), but in a way that is ""market-approved"". As long as someone can pay for the harm caused, corporations don't have to worry about their business models. It's just a small fee they pay, it's indulgence trading.

Don't get me wrong: I'm not saying that we should not use market-based instruments at all. While I don't like the idea that you can just buy your way out of the mess you cause. I just think that market-based approaches *alone* don't give good incentives and are not enough to solve the problems we face today. I think what's needed is international regulation on a near-global level. While I agree that this is hard to accomplish, I think market-based solutions are just the easy way out for some governments that don't really acknowledge the problem. And many large scale regulations that were negotiated in the last century (think UNCLOS, which manages the protection of the Oceans) show that it can be done.

I think I can prove my point here, but as so many people seem to be gasping in awe when it comes to market-based instruments I thought I'd like to hear the arguments of the other side.

CMV: I'm a democrat and I see Biden as my enemy. I feel no obligation to vote for him.,"I'm 24 years old. Relatively young. But I can't even count how many friends/peers i know that are dead. I've lost count. Nearly all of their deaths would have been easily preventable had someone who had power gave a shit about them at all.

I should be dead too. But obamacare went into effect 5 months before I needed care. The aspects of the ACA that saved my life have since been stripped away by the private insurance companies that were still allowed to exist, and a biden administration would still allow to exist. He even said he'd veto M4A. He said it himself. ""Nothing would fundamentally change"". He fully supports the system that killed my friends, and almost me.

So no, I don't feel an urge to ""vote blue no matter who"", i feel an urge to vote for someone who is willing to fight for others, or tell them to fuck off. Trump gets hell for putting immigrant families in cages, but the obama-biden administration built those cages, and deported more people than trump in the same window of time. In terms of foreign policy, biden played such a huge role in the gutting and destruction of Libya in 2011, which is disgusting and beyond defending. He's shown to be racist, homophobic. Why should I vote for a racist homophobic warmongerer with dozens of sexual abuse accusations and love for mass deportations just because they have (Democrat) next to them on the ballot? I'm not a well off person that can treat politics like it's sports so i have to support my team.

I thought of the concession, Biden's cabinet picks would likely be better than trump's, right? But seeing the leaks (bloomberg for the world bank is terrifying) I even have to concede there. I worry a Biden administration would be worse in the long term. It would allow well off liberal types to pretend that now it's fine, since the evil villain was defeated. Suddenly they don't have to worry about ICE anymore. Racism is gone, guys. He would modernize the brutal system, Biden would stand as the slave owner insisting he treats his slaves well, making something exploitative and horrific seem more appealing, making something that might seem to others as progress end up only prolonging suffering.

I'll likely vote green party. I don't see it as voting in an election at this point, but a survey. Saying i'm not supported by biden, or trump, so i won't support either in return. Hopefully the democratic party will see a large influx of disenfranchised young voters and try to reach them, but seeing them do the same strategy that cost them 2016, i doubt learning is something they're willing to do.",2020-03-11 08:18:17,changemyview
"cmv: If you hate anti-Vaxxers as they endanger the life of their children, by that logic people performing abortion also deserve the hate and opposition.","Let me start of by writing that I don't care what your beliefs are. I have my own opinions which , I'm not here to debate that. I just want people who hate Anti-Vaxxers with passion to explain their thought process on why killing an unborn child is considered ok but not allowing your born child to take vaccines which might kill him or impair him is wrong. We have proven that vaccines do work, but we also have proved that a foetus has a beating heart within 2 weeks of ovulation. 

I'm a non native speaker so sorry for thhese messed up sentences.

Please don't attack me. I hate everyone equally. I'm curious as to know how this view can be countered by proper logic and though process.",2020-03-11 06:31:34,changemyview
"CMV: If esports, gymnastics, synchronized diving, and dancing are considered sports, I think marching band should also be considered one.","Hi everyone. Before I start, I wanna give some background info about myself. Throughout all of high school, I was an athlete and a musician. I have ran track for five years (grade 7, 8, 9, 11, and 12) and played basketball for a couple. While I no longer play basketball competitively, I do play recreationally. I am also in a marching band and have been marching for two years (senior year of high school, freshman year of college).


What I want to know is why marching band isn't considered a sport while organized competition such as esports and gymnastics are. To be clear, I 100% see gymnastics as a sport. I'm a little iffy on esports, but I wholeheartedly believe that anything in the Olympics is a sport. 


Marching Band, particularly at the competitive level requires a fairly high degree of physical exertion (especially depending on what instrument you play), mental effort, and strategy. 


The most distinct difference between marching band and other organized competition that we consider sports would be the fact that it produces music while also requiring a degree of physical exertion. But is that really enough to disqualify it from being a sport? Many sports are unique. Archery for example is nothing like most sports. Neither is NASCAR. Baseball is also relatively unique. 



A common argument I see is that marching band is an art. It's expressive. While I certainly don't disagree, couldn't the same be argued for gymnastics, dance, or figure skating? Each of these also have judges that score you based on the difficulty of the technique you used.  Similarly, marching band judges judge based on proper technique and how complex the marching maneuvers and music are.


As for esports, I just don't understand why they're more of a sport than marching band. Not to take credit away from professional gaming competitors at all, but what box does professional gaming check that marching band doesn't? Is it revenue? The size of the team/amount of players? As far as I'm aware, both require physical and mental effort, strategy, skill, practice, and are competitive.",2020-03-11 04:51:45,changemyview
CMV: The media is creating mass panic over the coronavirus.,"Health officials have already stated, it's a mild illness and people should not be panicking. (https://www.health.state.mn.us/diseases/coronavirus/basics.html#concern) 


 But left and right you see news outlets with headlines saying the economy is about to collapse because of the coronavirus (https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/03/perspectives/coronavirus-economy-recession-fed-rate-cut/index.html) or how the only way to stop a virus is to close everything (https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/03/coronavirus-cancel-everything/607675/)


If anything DOES happen with the economy, it's a direct result of the media sensationalizing something so mild.


THOUSANDS have died from the flu in the US alone this season, but no one says anything. 20ish people from coronavirus in the US, and people are fighting over toilet paper.


People need to educate themselves as well and calm the fuck down. It's not the end of the world, you're probably not going to get sick, and in the unlikely event that you do, there's a 98% survival rate if you're an average healthy adult. Don't go spend your life savings on masks and shit. Go buy food because this media hype might actually lead to people staying in their homes for a while.",2020-03-11 04:12:14,changemyview
